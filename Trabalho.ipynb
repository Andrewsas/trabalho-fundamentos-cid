            "For those who enjoy freshwater fish, try these delicacies at Augustus. Very good service, place and price. Well prepared food and good side dishes, just the mush I didn't like.\n",
            "Located in the city center, it offers a varied free buffet with salads, fruits, hot vegetarian and wholesome options, as well as grilled meats. It has 2 options of delicious soups with side dishes. It also has fried options, like pastries and dumplings, but lots of healthy options too. The dessert buffet is also hearty. Spacious location, with ground floor tables and mezzanine. Still a delicious complimentary coffee on the way out!\n",

            "Pleasant place, cozy atmosphere, well decorated and with a great buffet of snacks with very tasty items of Arab cuisine.\n",
            "I recommend. Would go back!\n",
            "It's a classic from Porto Alegre. The best option for night owls. It is very worthwhile to know this dirty foot. It is worth eating the capeletti soup after drinking them all.\n",
            "Many varieties of accompaniment, different types of açai, price per kg. Great place to go with friends.\n",
            "The dish is well served, with tropeiro beans, macaxeira, farofa .. it is good, but it leaves something to be desired, in front of the other steakhouses in the city.\n",
            "Frango do Moura is one of those places well hidden and away from the tourist circuit. I really like the special flavor of the authentic Frango do Moura, accompanied by the best farofa in Salvador, it is worth the visit.\n",
            "Differentiated place, which brings the proposal of Uruguayan restaurants where a differentiated grill is served. Every day the restaurant has a cut on sale. Everything freshly prepared, being possible to sit at the counter during meals. The restaurant is usually full every day and therefore there may be no table available upon arrival. Restaurant frequented by residents and visitors alike. The price is right for the excellent quality offered. A must for anyone who likes a parrilla in Uruguayan fashion.\n",
            "The place has\n",
            "A wide variety of broths. It has tapioca and rice pudding. Ideal for cold days or when you have the flu. Very tasty\n",
            "a nice and very good option on the edge of the city to make a good meal, quality in a pleasant environment and with good company, it is not very cheap, it is more worth it.\n",
            "Inácio soup is a different option in Teresina, with a menu full of different and tasty options, good service and a clean environment. I recommend it!\n",
            "I always knew there was a long line, so I waited to go on a day when I could get there very early, so we sat down soon. The expectation was high, but it was super worth it !!! Surprised me. The environment is unique. I really feel like I'm in Claude's kitchen, or Jessica better. Great service and spectacular food. It is to eat “praying”. I left there thinking about when I'll be able to go back ...\n",
            "Wonderful lunch. Highlight for SERVICE and especially p. CHEF. Conception. I had lunch at the Olympic Penne and I RECOMMEND. I will always come back.\n",
            "I wanted to go to this bar / restaurant for a long time and it was worth it. It is in the center of São Paulo, on the famous corner of Av.Ipiranga x Av.São João, sung in the music SAMPA. There are 2 very different environments. An internal environment with a live musical group, and another external environment, a kind of veranda, closed, with a piano bar.\n",
            "The draft beer and snacks are very good. The service is tight, do not leave the beer glass empty. Reset is automatic. Importantly, despite being in the city center, I felt very safe walking through the region.\n",
            "One day passing by Clovis Bevilaqua I saw the establishment and decided to enter. I had a natural chicken sandwich and a juice that were delicious. I found the menu options very interesting and, as I usually eat a protein salad, I decided to order from there the next few times. Right away I realized that the price was around 20% more expensive than other places I usually ask for. But if it were as good as it looked it would be worth it.\n",
            "The first time I ordered a gluten-free and lactose-free chicken salad and the second time a shrimp salad.\n",
            "The service was good and the salad arrived on time, visually well cared for. Now I found the small portions, mostly of protein. Both chicken and shrimp. The shrimp is also very small. The honey and mustard sauce is great.\n",
            "It's not bad but I think there are other better options at a lower price.\n",
            "I asked 2 times not to be unfair.\n",
            "I have been to several Japanese food restaurants, but to date none has compared to Kawa at Alameda Lorena. The dishes are delicious and different and the service is great. In addition, Kawa da Lorena is a concept restaurant and the decor is modern and sophisticated. I recommend!\n",
            "I was at Olivos in 2013 and the service had been good. I returned\n",
            "now in 2015 and what a disappointment. People seem to be doing you a favor and they don't even give you a good night. One of my friends dropped her beer on the table and for someone to come and help her it was a birth! Finally, there is a bearded waiter who attends the back area who could be more friendly, every time we asked him to serve us he looked like a few friends. Never come back and never recommend.\n",
            "Delicious, homemade food, good service, good prices. I was very well received and the atmosphere is super nice, it's worth it!\n",
            "Great cost benefit. With option for Vegetarians. In addition to the traditional green beans, brown beans were also seasoned only with vegetables. In addition to a good variety of salads. Dessert buffet with few options and no diet options. \"Yes, but it's over\".\n",
            "It is in Pampulha which is a little far from the center so it is worth going to spend the day. If you have children it is a great place because they have a playground, zip lines, you can see the animals on the farm and ride a buggy. It gets very crowded on weekends so get there early.\n",
            "Good confectionery with a great variety of cakes and other sweets.\n",
            "The cakes are a little sweet, but nothing to spoil the caloric wonder. LOL...\n",
            "Great service and atmosphere, but I didn't really like the roasted meats, I found them all with the same seasoning. The buffet I found very good.\n",
            "Good tent on the edge of João Pessoa, with tasty food and fair price, good and honest service, drinks with normal prices, I went on Monday with a humor show with the little fish, 5 reais of very well paid cover, clean bathroom, I sure did would go back and recommend!\n",
            "Delicious regional food with various typical foods. So tapioca is very tasty. The decor of the place is fantastic. I recommend it and I will definitely be back.\n",
            "A large and well decorated place with delicious food and first class service. An excellent wine list.\n",
            "Best lasagna I have ever tried! Nice atmosphere and very good service, but I think it is important to book because it is a little smaller restaurant!\n",
            "Valet at the door facilitating\n",
            "Beautiful place, very friendly waiters. Wonderful carvery. Be sure to eat nothing, because it's all very good ...\n",
            "It continues to be the great reference of a good Picanha on the grill, served in a charcoal dish with onions, a highly welcoming environment under trees and with excellent service.\n",
            "The place is small, but very cozy and clean, with very friendly attendants. The food and drink were delicious, I loved the Peruvian food! The only thing that I put is the location, to get there on foot there is a little bit of the path that is very dark, which made us afraid. But otherwise, great! I recommend!\n",
            "It was a quick visit, but very pleasant, cozy atmosphere, great service and tasty food. I recommend!\n",
            "The place is very charming. Beautiful staff, very good service. Prices are a little steep. And the delicious, but tiny portions. It is worth it for the environment.\n",
            "Pizzeria with a cozy atmosphere and at the same time well decorated, great service, wonderful pizzas, different flavors and quality ingredients. Cold beer, always.\n",
            "Delicious restaurant bar to eat and go with young children. It has a kids space with monitor.\n",
            "The food is wonderful, drinks and juices well served\n",
            "One of the restaurants of a large teresina chain, favorite chain, this one specializes in regional foods\n",
            "Relaxed atmosphere, great for spending hours having a cold beer, with the best of gastronomy, I recommend the roasted rib. Wonderful. Price according to what is delivered, therefore very fair.\n",
            "Whenever I buy pretzels with sugar and cinnamon, this time I ordered the dulce de leche !! If it were a mixture of the two it would be perfect, like churros !!\n",
            "Really a restaurant to try: healthy, organic and really tasty.\n",
            "I recommend going there to have lunch after a footing on the beach to recover your energy;)\n",
            "The place on the side of the highway presents good dishes, with emphasis on the shrimp, tasty and very well prepared. highlight also for service.\n",
            "Very good service, environment full of trees, peace in the middle of the city. It doesn't come cheap, but it is excellent\n",
            "The place is decorated in an unusual way, with a mix of antiques and old and new things, well kitch but fun. The band that played first (Galeria do Samba) deserved a 1000 note, the service was very friendly, although a little confused. The price corresponded to the type of place. I recommend and will be back.\n",
            "Every time I pass through Salvador, I always go for a meal at \"A Porteira\". Whether at Dique do Tororó, or at Boca do Rio. The meat from Sol is wonderful! The beer, very cold, and the very attentive waiters !!!!\n",
            "Reading the menu I didn't find the dishes very inspired, but when I tried them I was surprised. Each ingredient of the dishes is prepared in the best possible way, the end result is wonderful.\n",
            "And the prices are very reasonable for SP.\n",
            "The wines are also different, good and at the right price.\n",
            "I will come back often.\n",
            "It's a super simple place, and with an even simpler menu. But the service is good, the food is great and the beer is very cold! It is also a good place for children, due to the wide green area around it. Oh, and the price is very quiet !! Super recommended!\n",
            "At first glance, it looks like an ordinary restaurant, with skimpy tables. The perception starts to change when you are attended by the waiters, very polite, friendly and experienced. It gets better when you choose your main dish, in the middle of a menu full of different options. It is even better when you receive the meat and the accompaniments start to be delivered, in small portions but repeated at will, always freshly prepared. It is rounded off with delicious desserts. All of this accompanied by a wine chosen in an excellent menu. The price is not low, but the cost-benefit ratio is totally worth it.\n",
            "Central location of Rio Vermelho. Professional service, entrance (couver) took a while but it was delicious. Main dish of shrimp risotto, super delicious, very well served and detail, use Arborio rice, unlike many, and the shrimp delicious, fresh, firm, where you realize it was freshly made. I recommend.\n",
            "Tasteful decor, perfect service. Tasty, hearty dishes and compatible prices. Wide variety of meats, fish and pasta. Near the waterfront avenue. Opens for lunch also until 4 pm.\n",
            "I went to lunch with my boyfriend and we left in awe of the experience we had. We ordered the tasting menu and it was an explosion of flavors. Everything very well done. The service was great too. We recommend it and will be back for sure in a next stay in the city.\n",
            "The pastel is good, but nothing big.\n",
            "The brand \"Pastel com Borda\" is famous here in the capital of Rio Grande do Sul, but I didn't find the best pastel I have ever eaten.\n",
            "Very good restaurant. Very attentive waiters especially Denis !! Very tasty food. It’s a great place to have a good dinner with someone special.\n",
            "Very pleasant, in front of Pajuçara Beach. Good variety of dishes, such as Chiclete de Camarões and Mix Grill do Mar, composed of shrimp, fish, squid, octopus, mussels, lobster and scallops grilled over soapstone, with accompaniment, always well served.\n",
            "Dishes that serve two people very well.\n",
            "After the meal, a short walk along the shore is very interesting.\n",
            "Excellent place. Very good grills and great variety. There are three restaurants, next to each other, and they are all full on the weekend. Menu for all tastes and pockets.\n",
            "No comments great service great food one of the best in Porto Alegre nothing to complain about I recommend a place to eat well\n",
            "Well, we arrived around 11pm. I asked for a water and it was only natural, the ice creams were over. They served the starters and then the main dishes, asking if we wanted anything else, as the kitchen would close soon. I know people in the kitchen have time to stop work, but I felt pressured, and I didn't like it. Perhaps it was better to have already warned us when we arrived, as we could decide to stay or not.\n",
            "The place is well decorated. There is no parking. It is easy to locate.\n",
            "As for the price, I found it expensive in view of what they offer: Arabic bread, some pastries, mini sfihas, falafel, a meat, small portions of rice, ... and other items (there are 21), but nothing very tasty.\n",
            "Although I don't like Japanese cuisine, I already visited five restaurants trying to get used to it, but none of them had ever won me over.\n",
            "We were very well attended and the carvery is quite varied, with many grilled, fried options and dishes that do not usually make up the carvery.\n",

            "Anyway, I can't wait to go back.\n",
            "We chose a beautiful sunny Sunday to visit this floating restaurant in Botafogo's cove, and unfortunately the experience was not very pleasant because just that day the restaurant's ferry was not working, and access to it was made by a very unstable improvised vessel, making boarding and disembarking very risky. You can become the point of this summer if you avoid such inconvenience, because although expensive the gourmet bar food is pleasant and the view is simply unique, at the foot of the Sugar Loaf and looking at the Redeeming Christ. It's worth the assault. Another problem is a popular agglomeration in the pier (I do not mean the people of the wall, but those who occupy the pier). It would be better to have another place more consistent with the restaurant's proposal.\n",
            "Beautiful and pleasant place, ideal for a romantic dinner or happy hour with friends, not to mention the incredible dishes! Excellent service, especially the waiter Alex, very friendly, attentive and great photographer! Kkkk\n",

            "As he had been praised by some friends, we decided to visit the \"one-dish restaurant\". But expectations were not met. The meat is good. And only. The \"secret\" sauce is a mustard base, tasty, but also nothing exceptional. The fries are well-made and delicious, but nothing much different from what you eat in other good restaurants. Advantage: free refill. In short, it is a restaurant that, as it proposes to have only one dish, this should be far beyond the average and that does not happen.\n",
            "A special highlight is the draft beer (Stella Artois) and desserts (especially the cheescake).\n",
            "Whenever I go to João Pessoa I insist on going to Mangai. It is per kilo, and it has a lot of regional food options, in addition to the traditional food options. anyway, the food is always very good. Note: it is a little expensive, but it is worth going at least once in your life.\n",
            "Excellent service and environment. I suggest ordering the Tabqueray Ultimate and as a main dish, the escalope of tuna with angel hair with pesto.\n",
            "Restaurant with a good carvery, but the price is high for what is served. Very crowded, but in summary I recommend.\n",
            "In front of a traditional restaurant in the city and a great view of Praia do leme and easy access, it cannot be missed or known !! Its internal columns autographed by actors, VIPs and celebrities from all over the world and a menu with dishes chosen by the names in honor of these \"representatives\" of Brazil !!!\n",
            "Worth it as a romantic, family, with friends, children, celebrations, and any special date you can imagine !!! Whenever I'm in Rio I make a point of going to La Fiorentina !!

            "Snack bar that serves ready dish very well served and made to order. Rice beans meat and salad tasty and for a fair price. Service note 10. I recommend it to anyone who wants to have lunch while spending little but does not lack quality. I recommend.\n",
            "The bar serves different types of beers and domestic and imported beer. It has a slightly more hidden indoor area but with comfort and a relaxed atmosphere. They always leave a food truck in front of the bar to serve some type of food and they keep changing the style.\n",
            "I honestly would not recommend another place for a happy hour with friends or even a couple who enjoy beer.\n",
            "The price is right for the quality of the beers they serve\n",
            "Good for the whole family. Pleasant atmosphere and mouth-watering food. It is worth the walk.\n",
            "I already know some other stores in the restaurant, I like the cozy atmosphere, drinks are great especially the spectacular coconut, we ordered this time Jeri fish with garlic rice, very tasty.\n",
            "Very good service, quality food, good music, privileged view to the bay of all saints, I recommend.\n",
            "I went for a tapioca and coffee and I was really disappointed! In addition to being cold, the tapioca was dry and the chicken filling with ZERO seasoning. The presentation of the food was beautiful, but I never thought they could go so wrong with such simple food.\n",
            "Panificadora Paes e Doces Flor do Nakamura has nothing special, it desires much to be desired in quality and service and product quality.\n",

            "Sophisticated, pleasant atmosphere with cordial and friendly service. It has a variety of options of dishes with cod, it is difficult to choose one among them as they all look very well made and tasty. It is also possible to find other options for seafood and meat.\n",
            "It is an expensive restaurant but worth the visit.\n",
            "Excellent alternative with a lot of quality service and pizza. The place is spacious, with parking and has space for children to play !!!\n",
            "One of the best pizzas in town, eating from hand. Ample space but outdoors, not always pleasant in Salvador .... Besides, it's worth checking out\n",
            "Good food, but very busy, long wait for tables, because the place is small for the number of people who come for it on holidays. Reasonable price.\n",

            "This restaurant provides a terrible service, in addition to the employees not knowing what they are doing the food is terrible, they take a long time to serve and have no regard for customers. The only good thing is the location. This restaurant only survives is on account of the guides who force tourists to go there to eat.\n",
            "I WAS a regular customer, one who didn't even ask for the menu. Once, instead of having lunch as usual, we gathered a group of 03 couples for a small meeting.\n",
            "We ordered the best sake in the house. The friendly waitress promptly presented us with a Gekkeikan Black and Gold, presenting it as a \"Japanese premium sake\", confirming that this information was from the management.\n",
            "Calling the manager at the table, I asked him to confirm that information. He had the audacity to confirm, even written on the bottle in capital letters \"PRODUCED AND BOTTLED IN THE USA\".\n",
            "I would love to eat here, but due to this lack of courtesy and stubbornness of the manager, I will not be returning, since he thinks clients are imbeciles.\n",

            "Excellent restaurant and excellent service. I recommend it to everyone.\n",
            "Great service, great food and good value for money. Beautiful, ventilated environment, with good live music. The restaurant only works during the night, if I'm not mistaken. If you are staying at Ponta Negra beach, for example, the restaurant has a van that can drop you off and pick you up at the hotel free of charge!\n",
            "Yummy hamburger, very nice atmosphere, very good service. Some minor criticisms: the only guarana they serve is Kuwait, there is no guarana Antarctica !! The hamburger is only made with cheddar cheese, there is no other cheese option and they don’t make milk shake, I think it’s a hamburger tradition with milk shake, I missed it! But it's a good burger\n",
            "Very good for lunch on Sundays when a huge amount of Arabic dishes are offered in the buffet by the pound. All very tasty, in addition to the Kafta and pita bread freshly made in front of the customer.\n",
            "I love the Australian bread served in the couver, the ribs in the barbecue sauce and the fried onion. The service is always very good. The problem is always the queue to wait to enter.\n",

            "Large well decorated place, external and internal environment.\n",

            "The restaurant has good options for those who want to know Bahian cuisine, strong in seafood. The environment is all white with blue accents and inspired by local religious traditions. The food is good, but it is also not very cheap. On the day of the visit it was hot and some air conditioning units were not working. Talking to some Bahians, it seems to me that they prefer Kimuqueca, which is nearby.\n",

            "I highly recommend it.\n",
            "I love restaurants on the terrace. The view really is beautiful. But the atmosphere is a bit 'tacky', the songs look like wedding, to 'old man'. Those who like an old-fashioned romantic atmosphere will enjoy it. Modern couples will prefer the Skye Bar all their lives. But it is worth knowing!\n",
            "I'm amazed at this place. I researched the internet to explore new restaurants.\n",
            "\n",
            "We went on a Saturday, 20:54. As soon as we arrived we were greeted, asked for a table for 2. We sat at the table still DIRTY, we were waiting almost 10 minutes. A small place with 3 waiters and NONE even came to clear the table and leave the menu.\n",

            "The courtyard restaurant is always very crowded, which overloads the service, which is reasonable. The food is very heavy, but very tasty. Very cold draft beer and several drinks (drinks there are expensive !!!) Very good to go with friends and eat starters and share main dishes with their beautiful side dishes. Very good.\n",
            "upon arriving at the hotel, a cousin and I had a car in front of us, let alone a black fusion when entering the parking lot, the fusion that was stopped also resolvable to enter right after us. for some reason i can't remember which one we had to wait in the parking aisle the same fusion started honking like crazy my cousin without patience was asking what was happening was the owner of the hotel without patience to wait for his client to enter .... beautiful reception not .... the hotel was very bad the tv didn’t get right\n",
            "Cool and well frequented atmosphere, great service. Queue of about 30 to 40 minutes, but has sofas to accommodate some people who are in line and drinks and starters are served if you want. On Saturdays it is ideal to call and make a table reservation, as it gets crowded. Delicious and well presented drinks, I recommend the brut with cherry and the vodka with ginger and lemon. Affordable wines. Delicious and well served food. The dishes serve 1 person and vary from 50 to 80 reais, on average. I recommend the gorgonzola risotto with medallion, one of the best meals I've ever had. Shrimp risotto with tabasco is very strong, for those who are not a fan of pepper, it is not a good choice.\n",
            "This chain restaurant is not in a very attractive tourist place but the quality of the dishes and the playground for my almost teenagers pleased us a lot besides the live music, very pleasant!\n",
            "Refined place, with excellent Italian cuisine. The service sometimes leaves something to be desired, as it could have a little more waiters to serve the public. But as an option it is worth it.\n",
            "Whenever I can, like at El Fuego, great salad and grilled dishes and on some days of the week, women have a special price, which is very worth it ....\n",
            "Good and not too expensive. It pays to order a combo with soda and chips. The cost benefit with this meal is a good one.\n",
            "Excelent reception! Antonio and Orlando spectacular waiters !!! Wonderful meat! Best meat from BH.\n",
            "I love shrimp !!!!! There is no better restaurant in Natal with the best shrimp in the region, affordable prices, perfect service, I just have to praise it. My favorite dish is shrimp Dijon serves 4 people. If you go to Natal don't forget to spend there. I RECOMMEND!\n",
            "very pleasant environment, efficient service and sensational options for those who enjoy seafood (especially shrimp, as expected).\n",

            "The attendants in fact looked confused, which brought a little bit of annoyance, we had to ask the same thing 3x, and when we needed something we had to get up and go after the attendant, because he was in the back, and that day the bar it was not full.\n",
            "What paid off was the music, the night pair sang very well and answered our requests. The show and the sound made us stay longer.\n",
            "The bar is nice and has potential, but asks for more organization in the service.\n",
            "Nice atmosphere, wonderful food and excellent burgers, one of the best I've ever eaten. It is spread throughout the city: downtown, boats, shopping malls, etc. Super recommended!\n",
            "Despite being an event with the participation of parliamentarians, with the expected participation of about eighty participants, there were two hundred and eight. Even so, the house got the job done, with a little bit of a run, it is true, but nothing to hinder the great service.\n",

            "Very cozy space but for the price paid we found the service poor because it was empty and we had to keep signaling many times to be served. In addition, Zé do Pipo Cod was almost without salt and with little taste.\n",
            "Excellent restaurant, service, pasta and wine list! It is worth knowing and repeating the trip to Fiorino! I recommend\n",
            "Nice food. I recommend for those who do not like typical food. The service was not the best, but the taste was very good.\n",

            "It is close to the Gran Hotel Stella Maris. Nice and cool environment facing the beach, with beautiful people having fun. Varied menu, very good service, but the house was very busy at lunchtime, so it may take a while. We forgot my daughter's slippers and the staff was very attentive in keeping and returning them. Everyone was very friendly. Would go back more often.\n",
            "There are few tables, but the atmosphere is very good. The service is also great. The dishes are better than the other. I've been there several times, tried almost the entire menu and liked everything. It is not cheap, but it is consistent with what it offers.\n",

            "It is very common to go to pizzerias and in medium sized pizza you are free to order two flavors. Only medium and large size is offered there. And in the medium size only one flavor is allowed, where you are \"pushed\" to buy the big one, but for a couple it is a meaningless size. I didn't understand it as a \"clean\" conduct.\n",

            "The place is pleasant and the quality is very good, however the service is too long and leaves much to be desired. For the 3rd time I had no shimeji or nira, and also a simple bucket with ice. The cheese roll was served without the sweet and sour sauce that is traditional and the size is also the diameter is exaggerated and ends up taking away your appetite. I think the restaurant has a lot to improve.\n",

It just doesn't take my 5 stars because the prices are well above the reasonable. Even with all the qualities mentioned I see no justification for charging an average of 75.00 per dish. The bill was 280.00 (one starter, two main courses and a dessert). We don't even ask for wine. So, prepare the wallet ...\n",

The polpetone lives up to its reputation: crunchy, with a melted cheese filling and a flawless tomato sauce. I also ordered a linguine with a funghi sauce that was very tasty. Always good.\n",
            "The Mate of the Americas King is a great option to cool off on hot river days, attentive attendants which is a rarity, be sure to try the mate with guarana.\n",

            "Strip menu with good prices and cheaper beers among the same level bars in the neighborhood. The only bad point is the acoustics, I have a solution for this ... I am available for anything: Thiago Loureiro Fernandes.\n",
            "I've been to another chain restaurant and I wasn't really expecting much. But I was positively surprised by the São Paulo branch! We were well attended to the starter and main course were great, maybe a little spicy for my palate but nothing that compromised and the dessert was also very good. The location is beautiful worth the visit! I'm going to SP in July and I'm going to introduce my husband to the restaurant!\n",
            "good option to know the typical food and more. easy access and well located. The service made a total difference. The dishes are very hearty and delicious\n",
            "Delicious pizza, with many unusual flavors and combinations. Cozy and romantic atmosphere, especially in the most reserved area. Good service. The best pizza for me is La Vecchia (sun-dried tomatoes, mozzarella, fried garlic and arugula).\n",
            "I am a lover of pasta and pizza & pizzas serves me a lot! Location and service by far one of the best in São Paulo. The dough is also great. I recommend!\n",
            "Restaurant with a spit, with great quality barbecue, nice buffet, but without many options. It offers a very entertaining typical show. I found the price to be high compared to other restaurants in the area. But it is worth it for the general context.\n",
            "I've been going to the restaurant since the 90's, still on Rua Joaquim Floriano, well before the chain became so big and known. Over time, the restaurant specializing in chicken was expanding its menu and just yesterday I was surprised by the quality of the chorizo ​​steak. It was delicious, to the point, soft and tasty. I accompanied it with the salad buffet, which, although not the most varied, fulfills its role.\n",
            "It is a restaurant that has a very good quality control, where you can go knowing what to expect. Ever. I hope for many more decades !!! Ah, Galeto remains the specialty of the house ...\n",

            "And another celebration was there !!! Excellent pizzeria, wonderful flavors, customer service and attention! I recommend\n",
            "This restaurant chain is one of the few that follows the point of meat according to the customer's taste, from well done to bad past. Wonderful and tender meat. The pork rib with barbecue sauce and delicious. The best of all. The entrance with divine bread. The suggestions are great. A restaurant that deserves to be tried. Food with a good seasoning and quality products. The refill of the soda and juice is very good, cheaper than other restaurants charge. The desserts are delicious and serve to close lunch or dinner divinely. Very good cost benefit. It has quality and good service.\n",
            "It is one of the most traditional steakhouses in Brazil. Here I saw the waiter cutting the Picanha with 2 spoons, the quality of the meat served. The place, although simple, is extremely well organized and has a rustic refinement. The service was very clean and the food was very good at a fair price. If it is the POA, be sure to stop by.\n",
            "A perfect place for a happy hour with friends where the draft beer is always delicious, the capiroscas are well prepared and the snacks are phenomenal!\n",
            "Very good service, good food, but we had some mishaps, my potato came cold, while my husband's came peeling and dessert, I think it would be better if it was heated, but maybe it's a matter of opinion. The meats were excellent, in the right spots, the sauces were also very tasty. The cold drink ... I don't think we really got lucky, but we intend to go back and give it another chance!\n",
            "The waiters Jorge, Thiago, Anderson and the promoter Elizandra, are excellent! The attention to the elderly and children was impeccable!\n",
            "I really enjoyed the restaurant on our first visit. We plan to return again and again. Very good cover, varied starters and several options of main dishes. Tasty food with good presentation. Exquisite family lunch. Lean wine list, but with good options and fair prices. We recommend.\n",
            "For those who like to enjoy a good feijoada, the Bar do Mineiro is the place to be. Pleasant atmosphere and satisfactory service.\n",
            "One of the excellent restaurants in Belém, either for its delicious food or for its quality service. One of my lunch or dinner options in the city.\n",
            "Prime location and easy access!\n",
            "I was on Thursday 08/30/2018 after a court hearing. I arrived only at 2:40 pm and was very well attended. I had lunch tuna sealed in a sesame crust over a layer of pear mousse with confit pupunha palm heart tagliarini. I ordered Italian bread to accompany it with olive oil. Malbec wine to accompany. I can say: FASANO standard in Vitória - ÉS.\n",
            "The atmosphere is very pleasant, very cozy. It has tables on the street. Menu with several options of beers and draft beer, however, does not have many sparkling wines, and what I ordered was missing.\n",
            "I believe it is one of the best options in the neighborhood.\n",
            "Great meats, but be sure to eat the starters. Pastry and cheese cake were wonderful. Reasonable price, excellent service.\n",
            "Exceptional restaurant, self service style. Whatever you think in terms of salad, you will find. And all of the highest quality. In addition to various types of hot dishes and meats, the place also has a magnificent barbecue, with meats of impressive quality. The service is excellent and the price is right. Negative point? I didn't see any !!!\n",
            "For those who like muiiiiiiiiitooooo thin pizza it is great. My wife and daughter loved it. I prefer pizzas with more dough. Beautiful and very clean place. Many residents of Fortaleza indicate it as the best pizzeria in the city.\n",
            "The atmosphere is very cozy. Great service, with attentive and helpful waiters. The thin crust pizza is very tasty. I recommend it for sure.\n",
            "My order was a VG Shrimp with fried rice and pupunha. The waiter warned that they were out of shrimp, but he could put in the cavaquinha. I asked to leave only the pupunha because the fried rice did not attract me. He said that the chef could make a lemon risotto and pupunha. Upon arriving the dish, disappointment! The risotto rice was cateto, that is, the “risotto” was just a creamy rice with lemon and the hardest pupunha I've ever eaten. And what came on the plate could be anything but cavaquinha. No meat, no flavor ... I didn't return because I was celebrating and I didn't want to spoil the party. Luce never again!\n",
            "An Empório Saccaria CHopperia and Restaurant where you can find a little bit of everything. From special meat to wines of excellent standard.\n",
            "I love the restaurant, the food, the decor, the juices. Everything very clean. This place has a whole feeling, I was asked to date there ♥. Great option for those who like to know food from other places. I'm not a vegetarian and I still love it. Another cool thing is that the price is right.\n",
            "It is a place with a very nice atmosphere, but it is not big. I went in one day that there were several tables reserved for wedding reception, and there was a fixed point for them to help themselves. We asked for a table for 3, they asked us to wait at the bar tables that are on the sidewalk, on the side of the bar. Unfortunately they forgot about us, other people passed in front. When we managed to get in, we placed our orders, but we think that they have a little sin in the service in general, we were not completely satisfied. The drinks are more beautiful than tasty. The food was delicious.\n",
            "Popeye specializes in snacks, pastries, snacks and sandwiches. It is on Av. assisi, a great location! It is very worthwhile to try the pizza pastel which is a delight! super stuffed and dry! Super affordable prices. I recommend!\n",
            "As I am from Cuiaba, I prefer not to comment on Restaurants in the City, but I must mention something about Mahalo. And why the phaco? Because I pass by many Restaurants that call themselves and \"find themselves\" (eg, Mikla Istanbul - Turkey) just because they are located in \"pertussis cities\", but that, in truth, know nothing about what they do. I repeat: Mahalo owes nothing to any reputable restaurant in the world. If the eyes turn to places like \"el Bulli\", in \"ave Adriá\", I surrender the quality of the Mahalo and I say, without hesitation: \"ave Ariane!\".\n",
            " I recommend it, with my mouth full !!!\n",
            "Restaurant well located, within the park of the Residence and 2 quarters of the Botanical Park Emílio Gueldes. Restaurant with buffet by the pound. It offers several options of typical foods of Pará. Everything excellent. Highlight for the cub, pirarucu and excellent crab. It's really worth it!\n",
            "The real boteco, draft beer, great food, wonderful atmosphere, a mandatory stop at any opportunity in Rio de Janeiro.\n",
            "the packaging is differentiated allowing the pizza to still arrive very warm .... very well filled, it is just a little expensive!\n",
            "Well located restaurant, with buffet service, pity that does not work on weekends, Lots of variety from everything from salads to desserts, and it is difficult to choose. A pleasant atmosphere, with a price of 17.90, WELL ATTENDED, I loved it! Super indication.\n",

            "This bakery makes us understand what is the sin of gluttony, it is so difficult to choose that you end up taking everything. lol the bread is delicious, but there are so many other things that end up being forgotten\n",
            "the service and attentive a very nice space to meet friends the dishes served by the way are well served tasty loved it\n",
            "Good food, good atmosphere, price just above the reasonable. Overall it is a good option. The only negative observation is in relation to the chairs, all wooden and uncomfortable. If the point is to maintain the rustic style, small cushions attached to the seat would maintain harmony.\n",
            "Simple and delicious homemade food. One of the most attractive prices in the region. It only sins due to the lack of air conditioning, on hot days there is an oven.\n",
            "I have always loved the dishes offered by the restaurant, especially the shrimp with catupiry. However, I realize that in the Porto Velho unit the quality of the dish and the service is not regular. Sometimes I am very well served and as a delicious dish, just as often the dish comes totally different from what I am used to eating and when asking the attendants for a change, I am poorly served. Last time, the prawns were not very clean and the attendant replied that they were always served this way, which is not true. That is, to like or dislike here depends on luck!\n",
            "The restaurant is self-service and has food options for all tastes. Full buffet with barbecue options, seafood, Japanese food and more. The food is very tasty. The atmosphere is air conditioned and the staff are attentive. The restaurant also has a children's area with recreational facilities.\n",
            "Perfect restaurant. Excelent reception. Pleasant place with decoration consistent with the name of the place.\n",
            "I looked for an alternative restaurant near the hotel that we were in the Moinhos de Vento neighborhood and this restaurant was well rated. It really surprised me, because the menu has a wide variety of dishes, which made you want to try everything!\n",
            "I had a lemon grass iced tea that was delicious, with that citrusy and green taste.\n",
            "At the beginning we ate a cheese seasoned with a grain cookie (I don't remember the name), very good.\n",

            "And pistachio ice cream for dessert.\n",
            "Everything was great. I loved the restaurant proposal, it should have a branch in Campinas. ;)\n",

            "If you receive an unexpected visit, you can go without fear.\n",
            "The one I visited is at 405 Sul. Good dishes. A bit expensive. Ideal for meeting with friends, as long as you do not seek silence, since the noise at lunchtime is great. Very good service, except for the waitress trying to cross the plate over the table.\n",
            "A nice place to spend a few moments. Located on the upper floor of the Iguatemi shopping mall, it is frequented by executives and professionals from all areas, especially fashion. From 12pm daily, a pianist produces a more pleasant place.\n",
            "This hotel has an excellent restaurant that serves an excellent breakfast. With a great location in the city center, it facilitates access to all guests, I recommend it to everyone.\n",
            "The flavors are very interesting, the mixture works well. But I think it does not easily satisfy with a single.\n",
            "This restaurant serves several dishes, but I highlight seafood and fish, as in BH these products are difficult to find of good quality.\n",
            "Atmosphere, modern, with bartender, super sophisticated. In the restaurant environment an excellent service and for me the Shrimp fried in garlic and oil and then the International Shrimp, ours is just wonderful.\n",
            "I only suggest making a reservation, as the wait takes a little while.\n",
            "But it was worth knowing this restaurant in BH, beautiful decoration and high quality and service.\n",
            "I highly recommend it.\n",
            "very good ribs a great order, accompanied by the breaded onion and grated with that zero grade draft beer all very good.\n",
            "Great restaurant, following the Madero pattern. Service note 10, the sandwich was great! The only problem is the size of the queue. I recommend (if you are not in a hurry)!\n",
            "Buffet restaurant, at a low cost and with wonderful food. In addition, dessert is complimentary and a juice too.\n",
            "It is not a scale.\n",
            "It has a fixed cost.\n",
            "The Palafita is open during the day as a restaurant and at night as a nightclub. The food is good, but the dishes are enough for two people. For those who went alone, like me, lost money and food. They have a wonderful view of the Guamá River, and the service is good.\n",
            "Very good environment to have a beer and enjoy a great lunch with the family, with first quality meat\n",
            "Very good restaurant ... Service note 10 ... Cozy.\n",

            "Excellent wine bar, with almost one hundred bottles arranged in enomatics, very well selected by the director of ABS-SP Arthur Azevedo, very eclectic distribution, covering a wide range of countries and styles. It also has a sparkling bar, a varied wine list and great snacks to exercise harmonization. Prices, as is common in São Paulo, are quite high, but it is worth the visit. Selected frequency, super attentive waiters and a high-level sommelier. I recommend it to all wine lovers who go to São Paulo.\n",
            "The service is very good, thematic environment is very well designed and decorated and the hamburger is identical to the one in the photo in the menu with an excellent flavor. I just didn't like the breaded onion rings and fries very much but in general I recommend it, it is worth visiting the place.\n",

            "Good!!! It is not difficult to talk about this super themed and beautiful place. Its walls are decorated with artists' clothes in half light that makes the place super cozy. And I can say that the acarajé they serve there is the best I've ever eaten.\n",

Now the feijoada and eating praying that it won't end up being so delicious, and with several side dishes (kale, smoked sausage, cassava, fried plantains etc). It's worth it and recommend it.\n",

I recommend! Be sure to try the flagship dishes and the sweet cocadas and the pamonhas are delicacies!\n",

            "Too expensive for what you offer. The portions are not well served, the names on the menu were different from what was served, when we questioned they said it was anyway. Weird. And the main factor that the shelled pitu we ordered came with the shell and it was not tasty. I swear we feel cheated. We pay dearly. I don't recommend it, it's ha is off our list and restaurant.\n",

            "Speaking of the pizza itself, it's honest. Their regular was asked to be very thin. \"Toppings\" ok.\n",
            "\n",
            "Caipirinha with only one option of cachaça: Ypioca. Problem that affects almost all restaurants in Fortaleza. Great failure of all and of Vignoli too.\n",

Dishes for another 45 minutes, nothing special! Poor service, poor cuisine! Never !\n",
            "The lamb that I ate an unprecedented gastronomic experience. And look, I've eaten a lot. Full, beautiful and, above all, tasty. The only negative point is the smell of a closed environment. The two times I went, I immediately felt that characteristic smell.\n",

            "Worst place to eat, especially when it comes to shrimp ... I made a donation of R $ 120 for the place, because I can't say that I paid for the food. that is not even used for fishing. Not to mention the variety of mixes that push you like pasta, sweet potatoes, fries, and so on ... shrimp that is good at all. I do not recommend .. And to brighten your night there is still a repentant who keeps rhyming to make waves with your face ..\n",
            "Nothing is cool: pastries with bad meat and insufficient cheese, horrible mixed plate (cold and dried meat, cold sausage, cold cassava) - in fact, the plate itself is just a container where food comes on top, since nothing it was done in it.\n",
            "\n",

            "I went to Outback with a group of friends and I really liked it. We ordered a breaded onion, ribs with barbecue sauce and french fries with cheese. The fries are one of the most delicious that I have eaten until today, well done in cheese. The onion is kind of greasy by my standards (I'm kind of annoying about it), but all the sauces that came are delicious (I think that each dish we order comes with a type). The soda is refillable. At times the service was confusing, taking too long to bring drinks, but in the end everything settled down. Great experience. I would definitely go back.\n",
            "We ordered the Mignon de Sol file. Very very good and very filling! The mangaba juice is excellent! The spoonful dessert with tapioca ice cream was voted the best of the trip !!! ha transfer hotel-restaurant-hotel\n",
            "I love the atmosphere, the draft beer (very well taken) and the food. The best is Santa Tereza, but they are all good. High quality German food, impeccable service and a wide selection of cachaça and liqueurs.\n",

            "The dish served at restaurant week was perfect. The point of the meat came exactly as I asked, very juicy and tender. I found the pear puree with wine reduction to be a very creative and tasty accompaniment. The dessert, although simple, was also delicious. The service is helpful and the menu price is good.\n",
            "Good food, cozy place, perfect service; now ... price is hot but worth knowing at least 1 time.\n",
            "We love the snacks and the food, always very tasty. The price is a bit expensive, but the food is of excellent quality. Worth it.\n",
            "The restaurant serves a delicious codfish cake, as well as honest dishes. Joaquim's codfish is a good choice and the individual dish serves people well. The only negative point was the lack of wines on the menu. Only on the third choice did the restaurant have the chosen wine. Good option for a Sunday lunch !!\n",
            "The environment is spacious, bright, ventilated and very pleasant. It faces the beach of Manaíra, in a great location. The menu is varied (a la carte), with many options, which caters for all tastes. Prices are reasonable.\n",

            "But there are some places where the service is to be desired.\n",
            "I already had another concept of this restaurant, but on the last visit my opinion changed a lot. The price is standard FIFA and quality of bar. I served myself with an international shrimp and, when I started eating, I felt like munching on sand. My wife then pointed out some black spots that I confirmed to be such sand. In fact, from then on, it was easy to see that it was shrimp feces in large quantities. I couldn't eat anymore. I expected a minimum of quality.\n",
            "Once again our service was fantastic Gleisson was our waiter this time, he helped us decide the dish and we loved it, first class food at the right temperature and fantastic taste. All this closing with a golden key with the good music and voice of the singer..PARABENS TO YOU\n",
            "Incredible meat and wonderful side dishes. The entree is tempting, with the best cheese bread of life, a special chive and a delicious salad. The atmosphere is very pleasant although very small. Worth knowing!\n",
            "Beautiful Italian restaurant in Porto Alegre in a place that used to be a chimney of a beer factory. Impeccable service, very varied menu, tasty food at a fair price. Excellent wine list. Secure place with parking inside the total shopping center. beautiful city, in my opinion.Well come back often.\n",
            "Excellent cuisine, with typical dishes, pleasant service but very time consuming. The typical dish is crab, which is quick to prepare. However, the moqueca took a long time.\n",
            "We went to the KI restaurant and were well attended, good food, and a nice place. At the beginning of the guide, rolls and we ordered a combination that was very good. In short a good Japanese restaurant.\n",
            "The pieces were very fresh, very tasty. It has some very good sweet pieces too, like the casadinho roll (cheese and guava) and the prestige rolls with strawberry.\n",
            "I went to the restaurant for the history of the place and for the evaluations. It started with the waiter leaving the cover on the table without being asked. I know it is a common practice and we would ask for it anyway. There was also a cheese plate that we thought was part of the cover charge. Well, it was not and was charged without being asked. Typical opportunistic and unethical restaurant procedure. Then we order the main dishes: pretentious names taken from French menus from the 80s. A sadness. No flavor, noodles almost pope (noodles are the basics, you know, I'm the son of an Italian and that dish would be the joke of the month in the family). The desserts (top hat and chestnut mousse) were the only thing that was saved. Anyway, it is not worth what it charges and still charges what was not even requested.\n",
            "Italian cuisine . Very pleasant atmosphere, very good food and honest prices. Chef Heaven is very solicitous and pleasant. I recommend\n",

            "I went with a large group, for the 2nd time and as the first time the food was very bad. The waiter who served us was completely stunned and grudgingly brought one of the dishes changed and an infinite delay in ordering. The order was not even complicated: 3 equal fish dishes and 3 equal meat dishes. He managed to switch from meat to chicken. The three fish were with shrimp sauce and theoretically each was enough for 2 people, but although it was a fillet dish there was something in the middle of the fish that looked like a thick nerve (or it was raw, we don't know) and we ended up leaving a good piece on the platter . The \"shrimp sauce\" consisted of a thick broth that completely hid the fish, containing 6 medium shrimp (that same number). It was cheap, but bad.\n",
            "The food is very good, but the service was not the best.\n",
            "They took a long time to answer us, it was difficult to order a drink or anything.\n",

This dose of edible happiness you find in Babbo Giovanni! : D\n",
            "Worst experience possible with this restaurant. Poorly treated on site and by delivery. In addition to the appearance full of delivery people in front of the restaurant that does not let us eat at ease. Horrible.

            "It is rare to find a place where self service is free for R $ 13 reais in the city of São Paulo. Even more in a region full of bars and restaurants with high cost and dubious quality. This is not the case with this restaurant. The atmosphere is very simple, the attendants are super friendly, there are not many options for food and salad, but all are equally delicious. You still have the right to dessert (fruit) and a coffee. It is very worthwhile to book a day for lunch with family or friends!\n",
            "This place is a mix of wine and spice shop with bistro, we were extremely well attended, the food was excellent, everything done with care, beautiful presentation, cozy place, a good place for family get-togethers, well located and with parking.\n",

            "I went back to Bistrô Esmeralda for a Saturday lunch and was very disappointed. The house has an air of abandonment. Very poor service with a single waiter. Dirty tablecloth. They do not offer cover charge. The food well below expectation. I ordered a carbonara tagliarim, the pasta was overcooked and the bacon was rare. A pity, because the house was much better.\n",

            "I confess that my curiosity was greater than my desire to eat homemade pasta with secret sauce, but I loved the experience, the decoration, the seasoning, the service, the place, the dessert. You just have to be careful with the bill, because it can get salty !!\n",
            "The fast food chain Mc Donalds was already better, in terms of service and food production. today there is frankly a relaxation and tremendous neglect with customers.\n",
            "A place where you can eat until you can't take it anymore. Carvery of pasta, salads and pizzas is very affordable and good. I would personally recommend the pizza a la carte which is excellent.\n",
            "very tasty and hype place. I loved it there because it is a studio that is a bar at the same time. So, there they have very interesting exhibitions.

They were embarrassed, unfortunately. I had two more co-workers and they all had the same opinion, although each chose a different dish. A detail too, we ordered a beer each and unfortunately they were not cold.\n",
            "Losing patience with this place. Last x we ​​were poorly served (I posted here on the trip), however, being a traditional pizzeria, with delicious pizzas and a good service history, we came back. For what? Again a terrible service. Badly mannered waiter and ironic (the same one who answered the last x). Despite informing by phone that they do not make a reservation, when sitting at the inside table (we always prefer the inside part, which is less noisy), they informed that it was reserved (but huh ?!). I complained about the situation and even willing to sit at the next table, the waiter said that he \"insisted\" that we sit at the table that was supposedly reserved (again with irony and all the aggressive gestures). Compelling. As the weather was not good, we decided to leave and try one of the pizzerias next door. A pity, it was the best pizzeria in town in my opinion, my family frequented the place for a long time. For my part, I don't return so soon. It remains to be understood that ñ pizza is just tasty, it is part of a bigger product, which is the experience, and mine has been bad on the spot.\n",

The atmosphere is excellent, wonderful views, first quality meats, a rich, varied and extremely high quality buffet. Well-trained staff, (Proactive).

            "This place really surprised me. The hotel is located inside the humble neighborhood of Santa Efigênia, and is difficult to find, for those who are not using a GPS and do not know the area. Outside this doesn't seem like much of a restaurant, but where you get inside all those impressions get washed. The place is well decorated and cozy, you feel like you are inside a large family home. Service, atmosphere, wine selection and food are all great. This is the best Italian restaurant that I've been so far from Belo (which is my hometown)\n",

            "In Mag shopping located on the edge of Manaíra it has a Spoleto franchise, but in Manaíra shopping it does not. It is a good option for fast food facing the sea. On weekends at night the mall is crowded and some ingredients run out.\n",
            "I think there is a lack of greater publicity about what the city has, so that it can be known beyond the waterfront and downtown. Bus lines should be more publicized.\n",

            "In addition to the poor service, the service is poor. They took a long time to answer us. Then they took a long time to serve us drinks. They served three out of four juices, and they were all orange, no difference. The fourth juice didn't come at all. My friend politely called the waiter, and he 'took it to the staff', wanted to justify, argue, instead of simply bringing the juice, or apologizing. Then he complained loudly at our table with the owner of the place.\n",

And the food ... is excellent. Well served, great price and with a light temper. We finally found a place to eat fish and prawns in João Pessoa which is nice and makes fish with fruit sauce, make up the fish cake with a pineapple and pepper jam and even season the mashed potatoes. On Sunday, the place gets crowded, the waiters are a little confused, but they do not lose their sympathy, which makes up for one or another slip.\n",

In other words, it is eaten very well. Excellent service.\n",

            "I live in Curitiba and travel all over Brazil as an agribusiness consultant. I love Japanese cuisine and this week I was in Cuiabá. I went to dinner at Haru for being close to the hotel. I found the atmosphere very welcoming and original. I ordered a ceviche and a drinck. The ceviche felt a little dry, and the drinck with little sugar. But I complained to the waiter who tried to call the manager, by the way very attentive, who tried to exchange both orders immediately. Soon my new ceviche arrived, which by the way took a little longer than expected, brought by itself, and which was EXCELLENT. The drinck also returned in the right measure. Despite the mishaps that occurred and the price a little steep, the service and attention with my complaint answered promptly, surprised me a lot. For sure, my next trip to Cuiabá, will have my visit to Haru again.\n",

There were a lot of people, it looked like a steakhouse, there was a family at the front table with a child listening to funk loudly. The place is packed, it's worth it if you eat a lot.

            "Located in Copacabana, Peixe Vivo is one of the few traditional seafood houses in Rio de Janeiro that remain active. The food is really good, the seafood is always of excellent quality, and the dishes are well served. Highlight for moquecas and fish with shrimp sauce.\n",

            "The atmosphere is very pleasant and in good taste, the service is good with attentive staff and the menu is very interesting. However, considering the price, I expected more from the flavor of the dishes. My dish was grilled giant prawns with very thin pasta with lemon. It came well assembled, with an appetizing look. But, parts of the shrimp came raw and the pasta came very sour. They passed the point on the lemon, which overlapped the flavor of the other spices, taking the balance out of the dish. For dessert a Nocciola semifredo with orange syrup. The ice cream tasted good, but it lacked creaminess, with a crumbling texture. It came served with little syrup, but as soon as I ordered it, they promptly brought more. In summary, there are several positive points in the restaurant, but I consider the cost benefit high because the taste of the dishes is very relevant to me.\n",

            "Two people ate rodizio and three other à la carte dishes that were wonderful too. And we can not stop talking about Walafe who always served us with great affection, attention and disposition, even though it was raining we dropped some money on the table and under the rain he went to ask if it was ours.\n",

I asked for the recommendation of the 2 best brownies (Belgian chocolate and Nestle milk with Nutella), I also ordered an iced coffee and Italian coffee. Brownies are pretty bad. Massudos, the crunchy cone is missing, moist filling, the intense chocolate flavor ... The coffees were good, especially the Italian.\n",
            "Ponto Gaúcho has a great cost benefit, whether for those going alone or in a group. It is a family atmosphere and has an excellent internal space and good options for lunch, especially if the customer wants the dishes that have chicken, as they leave quickly and have a very affordable price, Ponto Gaúcho is also good for those who want to buy warm and have lunch at home as they have good individual dishes called commercials and the price varies according to the mixing option. A bad point is that it does not have many parking spaces in the front and on busy days you will have to park on the side streets, another negative point is that it does not work at night and does not have an air-conditioned environment but its cost benefit makes it your main attractive.\n",

After a while in the the waiters spend less time and with less presentable meat ... This is the only defect that leads me to not give top marks ... I think they should provide uniform service during the customer's stay ... It seems that after for a while they want the customer to leave to clear the seats ... The service is reasonable, nothing that deserves great comments ... Anyway, a good place to enjoy a barbecue ...\n",

The system is free buffet of traditional dishes but there is an option, with a different price for game meat.

            "However it appears on the menu that the service fee is NOT charged, when we went to pay came the bill and next to it was written in pen a value with 22 reais more claiming service fee. The waiter claimed that he did not know that the service fee was not charged .... really ?! Are you kidding me?\n",

            "Valets are extremely uneducated. They practically force you to stop the car with them, if you don't want to, they scowl. Last time they put a cone in front of my car, exclusively in mine that I didn't want to let them park my car. Since they keep you from parking nearby, they tell you to stop the car away from the entrance. It's the only negative point\n",

            "In Largo, there is the most famous tacacá shack in Manaus: Tacacá da Gisela. Very clean, good service, but I found it expensive. As I didn't know it, I decided to try it and I confess it is not my favorite dish. The broth with shrimp and leaves that numb the tongue is very different from the broths that I knew. I was surprised when the girl gave me the bowl with the broth and didn't give me a spoon. She taught me that it was tradition to drink the broth like the Indians, straight from the bowl in the mouth and the toothpick serves to catch the shrimp and leaves. Since I use braces on my teeth, I asked to put it in a package and took it to the hotel, where I could try it with a spoon. Well, try it already. I don't think it's necessary to repeat.\n",
            "For starters I suggest codfish cake or needle file. For the main course we ordered the fish stuffed with shrimp, mixed shrimp and lobster muqueca, and Greek shrimp. All were excellent, only the Greek shrimp came with a very small portion for the charged price of $ 117.00\n",
            "Dispersed employees. I had to wait almost half an hour for juice.\n",
            "Perhaps due to the fact that the restaurant was very full, demanding a lot of attention from the employees, they were in a bad mood. On the scales to weigh both the meal and the dessert, the girls were rude.\n",
            "Despite this, the food remains very good.\n",
            "Regional food with buffet at will. Good options for meat, chicken and fish. For dessert, I tried ambrosia, rice pudding and hominy. Ambrosia is not the original (without orange or lemon juice), it is the one with orange juice, so it's not good.\n",

            "In the most, I recommend. The place has several options of liquors to enjoy.\n",

            "We went due to the fame and the internet comments and we were disappointed. The snacks are good but not exceptional for the price charged. The service was AWESOME, as if they were doing us a favor. They only open in the late afternoon from Friday to Sunday.\n",

            "Very pleasant atmosphere with delicious food. We ordered the starter rice cakes and a mushroom risotto with black truffle that was sensational, even though it came a little cold. It was a Monday and they have the option of rotation. We were lucky to have chosen to order a la carte, as it takes a long time to pass the dishes of the carvery.\n",
            "The restaurant is very small, with an intimate and very pleasant atmosphere. The wine list is harmonious with the offer of dishes, and meal prices in general are very cost-effective. Very good service, sometimes surprising. Several visits at different times with different groups of people (family, colleagues, acquaintances) allow me to affirm the unanimous assessment of excellence with which it was recognized. What stands out is the creativity of the dishes, their balance and structure. The strong points are the creative stuffed pasta, but even more robust dishes, like meats, are highly recommended. More than great, excellent option in Belo Horizonte for a pleasant dinner with contemporary Italian technique.\n",
            "We went for lunch and the executive menu is excellent. It has several options of starter and main course. I chose carpaccio to start and carbonara in the main, which was very good, but the egg mixture was strong, even bothering. This was the only \"defect\". For dessert, we ordered the carolinas stuffed with chocolate ... We love it !!\n",

            "I went to Bodega do Sertão for dinner and honestly I didn't make a good choice. The place was super crowded and I didn't really like the organization of the tables. Although the intention is to revamp a \"northeastern\" scenario, I found the tables very close and you can simply hear all the conversation of the other person who is at another table. I think that they should also limit the number of people to enter in order not to become a very crowded and talkative place. Other than that, the food is wonderful, although the kg is expensive. If I return to Maceio, I would certainly not return there. It is a restaurant like others, only standing out for the decoration and typical food. Factors that already exist in other places.\n",
            "It is a restaurant specializing in regional cuisine. I really like the picanha, carne do sol and chicken. The butter in the bottle is great.\n",
            "great food (as always) good quality excellent seasoning and impeccable service from the caterer.\n",
            "Very good service, great food. Just ask for the abusive prices of the drinks in which 4 Coca Cola KS cost 30 reais and the abusive price of artistic cover.\n",
            "The location is pleasant and the service was good. In the evening, we opted for the free buffet, which offered a good variety of sushi and good quality salmon. It is not the best Japanese cuisine in Porto Alegre, but this is compensated by the good atmosphere and the reasonable price. I recommend.\n",

            "The New Burger does not have any glamor and nothing special, but the price is good and the food is fair, their parmigiana file I believe is the best dish in the house, worth a try.\n",

It met my expectations ... super dough to the tooth, light seasoning and a touch of wonderful lemon! Not to mention the burrata cream, which could have an extra! Haha WONDERFUL! Loved it!!\n",
            "Small room under the Borges de Medeiros viaduct. Simple, clean, cozy place with a wonderful Uruguayan pancho !!!! Made on a whim, very well attended. There are no tables on site, just a counter, but enough for a quick snack. In addition to the pancho, they offer other Uruguayan items, such as \"Ricarditos\", alfajores and pomelo soda! I loved it!\n",
            "I always passed in front of the restaurant and I never entered because friends always told me that the prices were exorbitant ... until I got up my courage and went. And the prices are not that absurd. The dishes can be divided by 2 people, which is worth it. Be sure to try the spring roll (I followed people's advice and it really is great) and the caramel banana. I also ordered a chicken curry which was ok, it could only be a little less spicy (and look how I like pepper ...) The atmosphere is beautiful and very traditional (try to get a table near the window to admire Copacabana beach! ) A great surprise!\n",
            "Restaurant with good cuisine and several options of dishes. The chef is one of the most renowned. But the best thing about the restaurant is the beautiful view of São Paulo. Ivoirien do sol is very beautiful\n",

I recommend going early because of the quality and price it is very crowded, but nothing uncomfortable. super recommend.\n",

            "The Di Liana Restaurant, far from any fad, is synonymous with quality and tradition. Situated on a quiet street in the Ondina neighborhood, it offers a small parking and valet service at no additional cost. The place, discreetly decorated, is very cozy and welcoming. The food, of excellent quality, is good value for money. The service meets the highest standards of demand, both for the relative speed and for making us feel at home always. These are the ingredients that make Di Liana a great choice!\n",
            "The place is super beautiful, pleasant but I definitely didn't think the cost was worth it.\n",
            "The portions are relatively small, the price of the dishes was around 90 reais and I didn't think anything was too much. I've eaten in many much better and much cheaper restaurants. vomits with medium level.\n",

            "Nice restaurant, cohesive menu, and well executed food. I just found the dishes very diminutive. We went a la carte, I believe that the tasting menu option is more advantageous. The dessert was very tasty too.\n",

            "The place is very beautiful, with modern decor. The waiters are very attentive and efficient.\n",
            "We ate the Burrata for starter, which was very good. The main dishes were the termite (identical to the one served in Sal) and the medallion with risotto, both were excellent. We ordered the dessert brigadeiro to share and the size was ideal after eating starter and dish.\n",

            "Very good menu, with the option of rotating pizza on some nights (Ondina unit). The service leaves a little to be desired in times of great movement. Prices are compatible with the quality of what is served.\n",
            "Traditional Polish restaurant. I've known him for a long time. Always good and at a fair price. Frequented by those who really know the place.\n",
            "Excellent option for lunch with varieties of hot dishes, salads, grills, pasta and delicious desserts made by the house. In relation to cost-benefit, it is one of the best in Porto Velho (R $ 33.90 per kilo). Efficient service with constant replacement. From 6pm, a variety of tapioca soups (R $ 10.00 and R $ 12.00 per serving) and other delicacies. Pleasant space with air conditioning. Worth it.\n",
            "A place that serves a varied buffet, accompanied by a steak festival. Ideal for lunch on weekends. The beer is kept stupidly cold and desserts complete the meal.\n",

            "The restaurant is very good. When we went there, we tried a dish that was new to me, Chop Suey. I loved it! The food is very tasty and the waiters are very attentive. If you think you don't like foods like that, I recommend a visit to try to change your concepts!\n",

            "I found this restaurant so good that we went to dinner there twice .. Nice atmosphere with very kind waiters .. The regional dishes serve four people and have good prices .. Well everything we ordered was wonderful .. Sometimes you can have a little queue but it pays to wait because the line is fast as the food comes fast too.\n",
            "The food is unique in Salvador, although it is typical. The aspect of the place does not help, very simple, without ventilation and the aspect itself discourages the uninitiated.\n",
            "the muqueca de camarao is excellent, the service is very good and the view of the sea from the tables at the back of the restaurant is an attraction in itself, the only problem is the price, nearby restaurants offer dishes with a very similar flavor for much more prices it counts, but if you are not a resident of the region you will often visit the restaurant.\n",
            "With a spacious and cozy atmosphere, in this restaurant you can choose between the outside or inside. The menu has many varieties of seafood dishes. The attendance and services were done by a friendly waiter who suggested some dishes and helped to make the best choice. Price compatible with the environment and services offered. Highly recommend for a good dinner!\n",
            "We had lunch there .... More or less. Homemade pastries are delicious but the steaks leave a lot to be desired. Lots of garlic and spices ... Great point and service.\n",

            "The restaurant serves chicken primo canto, fillets with various sauces, grilled entrecot, piglet pururuca, trio of beans, polenta, various types of pasta with various sauces and even a salad buffet, all very good. I only went on weekends, when there is this menu, the tip is to arrive early or late as the restaurant is almost always crowded on weekends and holidays.\n",
            "Old and spoiled fish, tuna with a strange color, variety of sushi at the festival is ridiculous, hot dishes all dry and fried too. I don't recommend it, it's of dubious quality and everything takes time.\n",

            "From the personalized service to the quality of the meat, there is currently no better meat restaurant in Rio. Lean menu of side dishes, exceptional meat and personalized service. You choose the meat, the type of cooking and the roaster prepares according to your taste. The salad menu, with individual portions, is excellent. A wonderful gastronomic experience!\n",
            "Everything there is very good, like the original in the interior of Sao Paulo, but the feijoada on Saturdays is excellent, it has no equal, logically accompanied by the wonderful chop.\n",
            "We had dinner at Ksa on a Wednesday night. Like a new restaurant he feared for the inconsistency of the service. But it was nothing like that. The food was impeccable. I ordered the lamb loin (in barú chestnut crust, with port wine sauce and mashed manioc) and my wife the (already famous) house carbonara, which has an incredible presentation. As a starter, half a dozen breaded oysters. Dessert the collection of miniatures. Everything was wonderful. The environment is one of the most beautiful and cozy in the city. The balcony is fantastic. Adequate wine service (stopper) (R $ 60.00). Strong candidate for new favorite restaurant! Keep it up and good luck! We will be back.\n",

            "I recommend and will be back.\n",
            "Chica Pitanga was a pleasant surprise. When received by beautiful girls dressed to character, the restaurant has already won my sympathy. The smell was wonderful, the atmosphere clean, calm and ethereal, thanks to the presence of a beautiful stylized cherry tree in the middle of the room. The buffet was impeccable, I loved the acarajé. The best was Graviola juice, it was so thick and cold that it looked like ice cream ... the best I ever had. Congratulations\n",
            "I recommend the heart of barbecue, the pork ribs and knee, the game meat (wild boar and variants), the meat fondue, the desserts (apfelstrudel) and the good wines.\n",
            "Romantic atmosphere and great service. Missing the tropeiro beans and rodízio is just chicken. Price also a little high for being Taguatinga.\n",
            "Without exaggeration. I tried to enjoy Valentine's Day just to be angry and disappointed. I had tried to make a reservation over the phone, they informed me that they did not make a reservation for weekends. Arriving at the restaurant, one of the waiters showed us around and gave us the option to sit anywhere. We sat down but soon decided to change, as we found the table too high for the chairs and the music too loud. As we headed for another table, a waiter said he couldn't sit at the tables he wanted, as they were \"reserved\" (no sign or anything), and on the phone they said they didn't make reservations and the first waiter gave us the option of sit at any table. We ordered a meat fondue (89 reais) and a cheese fondue (82 reais), which was supposed to be for 2 people. Well believe me if you want, only one chopped french bread (that's right, only 1 chopped french bread for 2 people) in the cheese fondue and little more than a couple of chopped steaks (yes, this was supposed to be the meat fondue, from 89 for 2 people). By the way, it tasted awful, more like liver steak. The waiter who served us said that we could make a replacement. They accompany only cream cheese with no taste. As soon as we finished we ordered, as one of the waiters had said, replacement for bread and meat. The second waiter said, that he did not make a replacement (each one says something). I called the waiter who had said he was replacing, then they found a way to talk away from us, and he came back saying that he was replacing ... if he paid the price for another fondue (that is, he was not replacing). To top it off, absurd price of 15 reais in juice and 14 reais in an artistic cover charge, by the way, I found it very bad taste. We left there bored, disappointed and hungry (even though we spent more than 200 reais on a dinner). I don't recommend it to anyone, especially on holidays like Valentine's Day, as they try to explore you where they can. It is practically an assault.\n",
            "Thin and crunchy dough, delicious filling and top service by waiter Jonathan! The sangria is perfect!\n",
            "Great atmosphere, with high quality food.\n",
            "I was attended by Salesman Cristiano who was very attentive and cordial.\n",
            "I love this restaurant, for family, business and couple lunch.\n",
            "Super recommend!\n",
            "We had the pleasure of revisiting Fogo de Chão after the Rio Half Marathon and the experience could not have been better. Our special thanks to Reyven and Thiago, who served us very well! The food is wonderful and the service even better !!!\n",
            "The barbecue in general is good, although I thought my table was poorly served. The buffet is deplorable, has few options and low quality products. I knew better options in Natal.\n",
            "It is a great choice in Maceió, a very good restaurant. This is already my second visit to Le Corbu. But I confess that I was a little disappointed on this second visit. As we were four people, we ordered beer for one couple and wine for the other. Restaurant beer had no ice cream. None!!! So we all went for wine, which was great, but when we ordered the second bottle, it didn't have the same label anymore. I found neglect with us. The food is wonderful, I dare say one of the best in Maceió. It is very worth knowing.\n",
            "Be sure to try the moqueca, very good. The dish with shredded dried meat has a very light flavor.\n",
            "I went to this restaurant tonight and ordered a burrito to go. The best burrito I have had for a while on my travels in South America.\n",
            "\n",
            "Nice little colorful restaurant with little space. I ordered the pork burrito, which was a great size and full of flavor. I recommend and will probably be back to try more of your food.\n",
            "Great pizza, very tasteful and pleasant atmosphere. Very nice outdoor tables and very good service.\n",
            "I ordered a stingray moqueca, more pepper came than anything. Baião had 80% rice, you weren't really tasty! The environment is also not very favorable, especially at night, I realized it was a point of prostitution. But if you have the money counted, it may be a good option.\n",
            "The cinemas and advertisements offered fondue this June / 19 as a novelty and to our amazement, the waiter informed us that here in Goiânia they were not yet serving ...\n",
            "Now if the chain does not serve the city, it is also worth not advertising the customer ...\n",
            "I chose the \"Nau\", to celebrate my Turquoise Wedding. The place is ideal for celebrating big dates. Its menu is divine, giving you a great option to choose your dish. As for the price, I understand that it is within the brand proposal, to try to be different from sameness (flexible). I will not recommend a dish, as it would remove the surprise of the choice in view of its cuisine. Be sure to taste their desserts, they are magnificent.\n",
            "Reasonable! The atmosphere is good, the location is excellent, but the service leaves something to be desired and the menu options too !!!!!\n",
            "Best seafood, spectacular location, close to Vinicius de Moraes' house and cozy climate.\n",
            "The place is very nice and well located, good music, very good food.\n",
            "However, the level of the food dropped a little, since previously they served more tasty dishes (not variety but the flavor) ... I believe it is due to the high movement (always full house).\n",
            "Another bad point is the tables very close to each other.\n",
            "Positive point the waiters are nice and cheerful.\n",
            "Charming, a delight to go with friends, the most requested dish is rack of lamb, but I can't resist the breath of ribs in this restaurant, at the point, soft and juicy ... just talking about the water in your mouth!\n",
            "Domino's has good pizza options and they currently have a combo with soda for a very good price. The pizzas are delicious and come very well filled. It's worth the visit!\n",
            "The pizzas are good, the price is also reasonable and is well known in the city, but the service has to improve further.\n",
            "Good food. Pleasant atmosphere with a wide variety of dishes. The service is fast and the place is spacious and bright.\n",
            "when you arrive, you are well received, and are already faced with a beautiful decoration. with an open kitchen, all details are thought out and impeccable!\n",
            "\n",
            "on the menu it is so difficult to choose, it makes everyone at the table want to order a different dish to try. thankfully there is an option for tasting snacks, for those who are in eternal doubt.\n",

            "Good for coffee, either in the morning or in the afternoon. The decor is a little vintage. It is a popular spot there in Beira Mar de Mucuripe.\n",
            "We went to know the rustic today and we love it !! The food was delicious!! We ordered a bruschetta that was divine! The house has a wide variety of craft beers! The place is very nice! I've already added it in my restaurant itinerary to always go to BH !!\n",
            "Restaurant specializing in Mediterranean food, located in the heart of BH. Moderate service and tasty dishes. Fair price.\n",
            "Unlike the places we know, beautiful people, good drinks, a very comfortable and cozy atmosphere. Ideal place to chat with friends and have a drink. Sensational.\n",
            "Excellent restaurant, very good rodizio, very varied and excellent service, the desserts are very good, worth checking out\n",
            "In addition to the price, R $ 28.00 with everything you are entitled to, the taste, the location, cozy, organized and clean make this restaurant an unmissable place for visitors to the POA. Very kind and helpful people. And to top it off, a coffee sweetened with brown sugar !!! I loved it. Super recommend!\n",
            "Very well served portions of acceptable Northeastern food. It wasn't the best dried meat, the best string beans, or the best fish, but for the price it is worth it.\n",

            "On April 14, 2015, I went to lunch at this restaurant, which is located in Block \"B\", on the 5th. floor of the German Hospital \"Oswaldo Cruz\", as I was visiting my husband who was hospitalized.\n",
            "I ordered a \"grilled chicken\" (R $ 32.00), a fruit salad (R $ 6.60) and an espresso (3.50).\n",
            "Until I was answered to order the menu, it felt like I was invisible there. Nobody came to answer me.\n",
            "Well, anyway, the \"grilled chicken\" was accompanied by tomato stuffed with brie, rice, several grains and mashed mandioquinha.\n",
            "Unfortunately, the chicken was not grilled. It was \"sapecado\" (it seems that the chicken was \"grilled\" in the flame of the stove). Horrible. The rice and puree were normal. No gourmet, just the name.\n",
            "The fruit salad was already \"made\" a few hours ago. Nothing new.\n",
            "Coffee is also not good.\n",

            "---\n",
            "As I had to return to the hospital, of course I did not have lunch at the same place, but at the buffet, at the restaurant of the same name, on the ground floor of Block \"A\" of Hospital Alemão, on 4/17/2015.\n",
            "As the restaurant is very exposed, the service is much better, professional and the salad buffet, hot food and desserts is good (self service system = R $ 38.00).\n",

            "My husband and I were at Canoa dos Camarões and ordered a plate of Shrimp a Greek, which consisted of breaded shrimp with tomato sauce au gratin with cheese, over Greek rice, with accompanying fries. Mixed with the sauce and cheese, the shrimp lost its flavor and can easily be confused with any other protein. In addition, the rice had no seasoning and the fries arrived on the cold table. We don't think it was worth the high price charged - it left something to be desired.\n",
            "Best hamburger in town. As it is still new, it took me a while to get to know it. Best burger in town. Delicious meat, tasty drink, tasty potato. Wonderful!\n",

            "But the food is good!\n",
            "After a not very pleasant experience, we returned in the middle of the week for dinner, this time opting for another dish on the menu. The choice was Beef Tartar accompanied by a good Chardonnay and very cold. The choice proved to be correct, with both the dish and the wine being very good. Although the evaluation of a restaurant is due to the workmanship, service, etc. it is undeniable that the dish served has a great weight, as it denotes a kitchen slip or worse, how is it done? This time we choose the right dish and recommend it. In other matters, service and parking remain unchanged.\n",
            "We went to Boteco do França yesterday afternoon (08 / Jan / 2020) and ordered an Octopus rice with Baby shrimp that is simply SENSATIONAL ... The dish that serves 2 people is very well prepared and delicious, it feels like it was a risotto. The service was also very good due to the cordiality and friendliness of the waitress who attended us, a girl with glasses but I can't say the name saddle. On your visit to Salvador be sure to stop by this bar for lunch 😋\n",
            "Best restaurant in town. The octopus entry is simply surreal. It is worth mentioning that it is a house so it is necessary to book if you are in a large group, the price is not so cheap but it is worth visiting\n",
            "well located exactly near the old port shopping great service very delicious sandwiches\n",
            "I can say that it is a restaurant that I cannot go more than 15 days without going. Everything is great, the food is very good, besides serving me when I'm on a diet with grills and salads that come VERY well served and excellent price!\n",

In the second, the service was poor (with several free tables, the attendant said that he needs to check if there were no families with children, which theoretically could be a priority, to change tables) and in the third the Steak was too hard for the price charged.\n",
            "We ate three pizzas one of aliche, another Portuguese and another marguerita, for the price practiced the ham should be ham instead of hams, the marguerita was dehydrated basil which makes it horrifying and to finish the aliche caused a huge disinteria and intestinal infection almost instantly in three of our class on the same night, finally a hell of a bad trip through a land of excellent people, a pity so much disinterest for tourists whether for business or leisure.\n",
            "Very tasty, typical galeto al primo canto! Varied buffet, I recommend capeletti soup and spaghetti. Family atmosphere and great service.\n",

            "Nice place, but a little confusing until you understand how it works. The meat was very good (you choose and they bake), but they forgot to give us one of our pieces, when it came it was cold. Even so I liked the proposal and the beer was sensational, super cold!\n",
            "The tastiest I ate in town, Kimberly's perfect service, and the dessert was more than perfect!\n",
            "We felt a need for the Waiters to immediately clear the table we were occupying, even though we had already ordered 3 bottles of wine. The menu is very good but the prices are not in line with other French restaurants and at the same level we frequent\n",
            ". It was not the first time, but this last experience was not the best. Perhaps because the restaurant is always full they are losing focus on the attention of old customers and in a hurry to clear the tables. In addition, the quantity served is no longer the same. We left disappointed because we live next door and we will not be returning\n",
            "I don't understand the outcry surrounding this bar with such poor service and such banal food. There are better ones in town.\n",

            "Both in terms of service and quality of ingredients, Pitigliano declined. I have always been a customer, I ask more at home than I go there. But I hadn't eaten in two months. I was disappointed, the quality of the ingredients worsened and the size of the salad decreased and the price increased. By the way, the Tuscan pizza was horrible!\n",
            "Traditional bar in Belém where reggae, carimbó are played and, currently, lively brega parties called Bregaço are held.\n",
            "The place is spacious, rustic and provides a beautiful view of the river, but go prepared with money in your pocket or account, as the establishment accepts only debit. Another tip is also to be prepared for the terrible service and hostility of the employees.\n",

            "When traveling, it is always good to have a bookstore close by to carry that souvenir you forgot to buy or a book to read while traveling. Livraria Macedo is inside the airport and, unbelievably, it has no airport price.\n",
            "The restaurant, although proposing to show the cuisine of Goiás is a normal restaurant, like so many others across the country. The food and the price are honest, but nothing exceptional. Do not opt ​​for the buffet. Not worth it. It goes with the option for the same kilo.\n",

Well, it turned out that luckily I went to dinner there and loved it. It was empty and the service was great. The service is a sequence of Japanese dishes, interspersed with ceviches and some dishes from other origins. All in a beautiful presentation in wonderful mini portions. I highly recommend it for dinner, but I don't know him for lunch.\n",

            "Famous restaurant in Natal, with typical regional foods, both the simplest and even more incremental. Noteworthy is the not-so-recent offer of self-produced ice creams and very peculiar flavors that are, without any favor, delicious, and it is even worth going there just for ice cream.\n",
            "Good for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Whenever we go for dinner, I do not allow myself to stop taking \"that curd\" that is only available in Mangai. The João Pessoa franchise has been in Natal for several years, always making it a success.\n",

            "Small and cozy atmosphere. It has heater and wifi. The service is excellent. The menu and wine list is limited but with very good options. All dishes are prepared with olive oil or truffle butter, but there is still an option to grate the natural truffle on the plate on the spot and is charged by weight. We tried the couvert, very good, and ordered the \"Due Ravioli\", 2 types of ravioli, one of veal with truffled funghi sauce and another of boursin with truffled honey and almonds. Delicious!\n",
            "We ordered a french fries and garlic bread at the beginning. The potato was not dry and the bread was cold. For dinner we ordered Pajé (cold and tasteless cream cheese), Grão Vegano (which I exchanged for a beef disc - it was tasteless, without any seasoning) and Amapuá (the only tasty one that I could repeat, but also cold).

We had a great reception, where the waiter introduced himself, showed the table reserved for 6 people and asked if we wanted to move. When requesting water the waiter explained the treatment process done on the spot and showed the certificates. You pay once and as much as you want. A wonderful alternative for the pocket and the planet!\n",

            "I went twice already and I liked the parmegianas that I ordered. The problem is with the drinks.\n",
            "The first time I asked for a caipirinha that lacked an ingredient, my husband asked for another one that they said they couldn't do because they didn't have the ingredients either. Okay, we thought it was the day and this is normal (even though the house is not full).\n",
            "The second time the same thing, I ordered a caipirinha, I didn't have the ingredient. He replaces it with another and the waiter tells me he won't even ask if he has it because he knows he doesn't. What my husband asked for came wrong.\n",

            "Restaurant by the sea, with live music and great service. We tried the chewing gum of the shrimp, which is the flagship of the menu, but in a snack version and it really is very tasty, for those who enjoy cheese, it is worth taking the larger portion, the crab cone is also worth checking out and is served in a crab cone. crockery and the crab comes mixed with catupiry is very good !! We ended up having the Shrimp Pajuçara and the Camarão Maravilha, the two dishes were sensational, very tasty, we ordered the portions for 1 person each and we ate between 4 people very well, the dishes are very well served, not to mention that they are well done and stay with a very appetizing face! The caipifrutas were also wonderful, especially the strawberry, very well made in the right measure of vokda and sugar! For those who go to Maceió you have to check it out, super recommended!\n",
            "Extremely well served and with delicious food. The atmosphere is relaxed and the service is also a differential. The queues are a little boring, so it's worth calling ahead to find out how the movement is going.\n",

            "I live at 310 N, when they opened I was one of the first to visit the restaurant, great food! But today I went with my family, it was full, just a waiter, there was no water in the bathrooms, they were very dirty ......., service was very slow, I ordered a vegetarian masala for starters and came with a hair, they are not prepared for the number of people who are attending the restaurant, it is a pity because it was very good!

The dish is freshly prepared, in the middle of the room, and the waiter invited us to watch the process closely, explaining each step of what he was doing, it was really cool! As I arrived early, the dish was prepared quickly, but when many other customers started ordering this pasta, they had to wait, as there were only two waiters to prepare the dishes. But the preparation is quick, so it is well worth the wait.\n",
            "One thing is that, although absolutely delicious, the pasta is very heavy and a little salty, strong. They say it is an individual dish (in fact it is not a very large portion), but it is sickening to eat the whole portion, I felt that half a portion is ideal. I recommend sharing a starter and this main course with someone else (that's what I did and it worked really well) and everyone will come out super satisfied, because the starters are well served.\n",

            "The restaurant is highly recommended, has good food and prices are in the average of the city. It is off the route of the most popular points in Maceió, but it is worth it (there is even a free shuttle to the hotels).

I identified who the manager was, I commented again, he took the plate and said nothing, when closing \\ pay the bill I asked and the meat dish was tough, he had the sinism to tell me he couldn't do anything , it was from a large refrigerator ... Absurdly amateur and unprepared to serve customers ......

            "I requested a tele-delivery of this restaurant last night, 12/14/2016. A port cod, which was very good, within what was expected. And a grilled salmon that was awful. My dinner compromised the smaller dish, unfortunately. The salmon was very small, very old and full of thorns, it looks like they caught the fish's tail! We tried to call the restaurant at the number that came with the order, but no one answered. We then called the delivery company to give feedback. Unfortunately, you have committed, and you have committed a lot, I will not ask this restaurant again.\n",

            "The atmosphere is super cozy and romantic. The price of the food is a bit steep for what is offered. At least, I didn't find my dish anything unusual. I ordered a fish with spinach cream. The fish was a little salty. The service is excellent.\n",

            "I really didn't understand anything. Due to the quality of the rest of the group's restaurants, he expects to eat well ... But I tried everyone's dish at the table and only the fish was saved, even though it was out of seasoning ... I asked for a Bolognese dish that was not good, the heavy pasta, the dry meat, the bad sauces, the wilted salad ... disappointment. To finish it is extremely expensive! definitely not worth what it costs. Except for the service, I paid with pleasure because it was one of the best services I have ever had. exceptional service, food is not the height.\n",

            "Do you know real food with a flavor of nature, one that we are sure is good for our body ?! To eat without guilt and with many smiles. If you enjoyed juice-type açaí with lots of water added, this is not your place. But if you enjoy the real full-bodied açaí rich in nutrients, this is the best açaí I've ever eaten (and I do Pará! Açaí land !!). If you don't know it yet, it's worth a try.\n",

            "Going to the Laguna has been a therapy for us, the environment is very welcoming, quiet, inspiring, poetic, a cuisine suited to the place, an entrance with crunchy prawns, or even simple pastries and a mixed plate of seafood accompanied with a white wine with average Benificio cost (the letter is small) and everything we need to end the renewed weekend to face the week that will start full of Rio and national problems.\n",

            "It was my second visit to the restaurant, this time for dinner. I arrived very early, as soon as it opened for dinner and waited only 10 minutes at the bar. The service and courtesy are pillars of this house, which always leave us very comfortable, despite the great wait that accumulates on the sidewalk. The starters and dishes well served, the Italian fashion ... the wine list, I found it a bit salty, with a predominance of Italian labels, which could not be different. It is worth the effort for a pleasant and, for my part, very romantic experience!\n",
            "Great service from reception to the end. It just wasn't great for some details. Very good food, white fish and lamb ceviche with plantain gnocchi.\n",

            "I have never been so mistreated and under served in my life.\n",
            "Delay in delivery, poor service, tremendous lack of education. Only 1 waitress was polite, too bad I don't remember her name.\n",

            "I was at Didier on a Thursday night in a birthday celebration9. The place is super nice in a stripped chic carioca style. I asked for Polenta as a starter, which was super delicious. As a main course I ordered the file mignon which was excellent and the profiterolis for dessert.\n",

            "Another caveat is regarding the point of the meat. Very rare or extremely rare. They didn't get it right.\n",

            "\n",
            "SIZZLIN 'RIBEYE, which is described on the BH menu as entrecote and on their website it is against filet, two ends of the totally different \"same\" piece of meat.\n",

            "\n",
            "Both were asked to the point. The last came extremely past and the first almost raw, in addition to a lot of nerve and fat, that is, it is a normal fillet, it is not entrecote. See the pictures and draw your conclusions.\n",
            "Restaurant with wonderful food, first class service, good price, I highly recommend it. I've become a customer.\n",
            "The restaurant has great service, very cold beer, attentive waiters, the food is great, a wide variety of a la carte dishes, especially the free range chicken. The only drawback are flannels that face the restaurant, intimidating car owners to give them money to supposedly look at the car. I did not accept to give money to the little nights and I was threatened by them. Apart from this problem, I highly recommend the restaurant, without fear of making mistakes.\n",
            "We went to the restaurant as soon as we arrived in Maceio, full of expectations due to being the best rated restaurant here, but it was a disappointment !!! We ordered a shrimp, the seasoning was reasonable, but small shrimp and nothing much, my son ordered a salmon, he liked it.\n",
            "It is far from being one of the best in the city. The flavor, presentation, variety and innovations of Daimu and Sashiburi, just to give you alternatives, win you away. Not bad, but for what it charges you should offer more. The environment is also no big deal. Anyway, it was well below expectations.\n",
            "The dishes are very well done. The starters are very thin and delicate. Flavor predominates in any piece or choice. It really pays off. And the service is excellent.\n",
            "Nice place, service on time and on time! Although the house was full, we were very well attended. Perfect food, wonderful oysters.\n",
            "Lula at the incredible point!\n",

            "I live nearby, and have been attending for years. Very good food, because I am a housewife, cook and besides that I am a pastry chef. I always recommend it to friends. I love the lamb picanha with green beans and cheese pirao and the shrimp skewer.\n",
            "For me it's the best pasta option in town!\n",
            "Very tasty dishes in a cozy atmosphere.\n",
            "The staff are neither welcoming nor very friendly. Mastercard is not accepted.\n",

            "In addition, I was interested in eating shrimps, and the chef prepared some grilled shrimps (there was no such menu on the menu) with olive oil and, I still taste that dish.\n",
            "In addition to excellent cuisine, the restaurant has a very pleasant atmosphere and first class service.\n",

            "We called the manager, the police and nothing was resolved. The manager was rude, impolite, did not let us check the cameras, and on top of that he implied that we were lying.\n",
            "My brother-in-law and sister-in-law went to the establishment to help resolve the disorder and the manager was rude to them, not allowing any resolution whatsoever.\n",
            "I do not recommend this restaurant because I heard several reports that people were stolen there and there was no help from the restaurant.\n",
            "Drinks and food menu varied. I've ordered several dishes (salads, pizza, crepes, appetizers, seafood, meats) and all were very good and well served. The caipifrutas are also delicious. The downside is the cost.\n",
            "For those who like to walk with the family, it is worth checking out, quality cuisine, always when I travel I frequent this place.\n",
            "Good sandwiches at a good price, just like any Subway in the world. Unfortunately the employees leave a little to be desired in the speed what ends up leaving queues ...\n",
            "I stopped for a beer and lunch as possible, the owner was so hostile that I decided to move on, he then refused to give me the change from a $ 10 bill to my 6 $ R drink.\n",

            "Santa Teresa is a tourist area, so I can't understand your attitude.\n",
            "Better to walk through friendlier places.\n",
            "The simplicity of regional cuisine is combined with the refinement of great chefs. Delicious fish in the Amazonian style An unforgettable gastronomic experience.\n",
            "For a quick and healthy lunch. Salad options, vegetables, quiches and hot dishes, delicious food but lacking a seasoning and being hotter.\n",
            "Place and simple but tasty.\n",
            "The food is always very good, but I never know how to evaluate the service, because some waiters / waitresses are very attentive and others are not! the last time we had to wait too long as one main course came first than the other and the starters with the main course! I found it a little disorganized! But it depends on the day!\n",
            "Ice cream franchise that we frequent in many cities. In Curitiba the service is very good, pleasant and familiar. Central. Products follow the national standard and we approve. Problems encountered were the loud sound of the TV (which we reduced) and the air conditioning ... Too cold for an ice cream parlor, especially in Curitiba ... lol.\n",
            "Mc's lousy option, the service is horrible, always time consuming and with few boxes. It is one of the options to eat at dawn, after a party, so it is always full!\n",
            "Although, at any time it is full and the cleanliness of the place is non-existent.\n",
            "The bathrooms are always dirty, the floor and the tables too.\n",

            "The best Minas Gerais restaurant in Natal! Perfect Torresminho! Angu pastry stuffed with wonderful cheese! And the dulce de leche carved then ... Nossinhóra!\n",
            "The restaurant has a wide variety of dishes, prices are competitive and the food is quality. Happy hour has really good deals. It also has an excellent kids space.\n",
            "Very good food, differentiated service and the transfer is perfect with full punctuality.\n",
            "The environment is simple, just a nuisance with the noise of children!\n",
            "I have been to this restaurant that is a Pizzeria several times and also serves meals. The parmigiana fillet is great and the portion is big. We ordered one for 2 people, serving 3 quietly. The pizzas are very tasty. The restaurant is air conditioned and for families with children (which is my case) it has a huge playground, with video game, swing, slide, pogo stick, little house and several other toys. My son loves the place. I recommend. There is also a place that can be reserved for birthdays, without additional charges.\n",
            "The restaurant offers a variety of incredible dishes, it is difficult to choose just one! the completion of spaghetti al formaggio in the salon is a positive differential, as it allows the customer to closely monitor the dish preparation process, and learn some tips used there.\n",
            "I found the service quick, both for the dishes finished in the salon and for the other dishes.\n",
            "The biggest problem was related to the wine list and the drinks menu, I don't know if it was something punctual or if it is a recurring problem, but at least 4 wines were not available, so I opted for the lemonade, which was also missing several flavors .\n",
            "The service is excellent, all the staff are very attentive.\n",
            "Regional food.\n",
            "I ordered the Plate of the Good Memento 2014: pork with pumpkin puree and rice. I ordered a wonderful cashew juice.\n",
            "The dish was very well prepared.\n",
            "It's a bit expensive, the sandwiches are good, but not excellent .... the ice cream with chocolate sauce is very good, apple and banana tarts very good .... It has improved a lot by changing the fries for the salad ....\n",
            "I have been there twice for lunch. For lunch they serve excellent chicken and a divine pork rib. Another positive point is the service, the waiters are very attentive. I just don't like it when the restaurant employees lower the awning that gives access to the block, I think it even goes against the city's urban project.\n",
            "Space very well planned, cozy and with a service note 10. I recommend it, because the food is too tasty.\n",
            "I always go ahead, it appears on its facade “since 1973” so I was curious to know. This week at last, I went there to get some snacks for the trip: I ordered a vegetarian hamburger with cheese and salad and a special Beirut (filet mignon, ham, cheese, lettuce, tomato and tartar sauce, there is egg too, but I ordered without). I'm not a fan of vegetarian stuff, but as it wasn't for me, I tried a little bit, I don't have much to say about this burger. With regard to Beirut, it did not please, the filet was a little hard and the tartar sauce was sour, it didn’t match ... the massive and hard cheese .... I like Beirut filet a lot, and I like mayonnaise, tartar sauce and derivatives, I ate disappointed. It may be that eating on time and not taking it with you as I did, it is better ... the house has existed for decades and in a country where most companies break down in the first years, we have to take this into account. My experience was not positive, but as I said, for as long as the house exists, I give credit, maybe I was unlucky, I don't know ... I consider going back again to try another sandwich.\n",
            "An incredible restaurant with a very beautiful structure is personalized service. Wonderful foods\n",
            "The fillet in bread with cheese sauce is divine !!! The biro biro rice was also great! We sat in the open front and I thought it was kind of warm, next time I would sit inside.\n",
            "I really liked the carvery, very fresh fish and well prepared pieces of good size. The service is good and the desserts are also worth the order.\n",
            "Don't expect anything exceptional. I found it somewhat decadent and dirty. There is a picanha in the réchaud that the person can be at the other end of the room that will come out all smoked. For groups it must be worth it because the portions are large. If you are a couple it is to break up.\n",
            "The variety is small. I had the impression that, even with different fillings, the taste is always the same. Marguerita pizza has a touch of basil. What I consider one of the most important ingredients in this flavor, almost does not exist.\n",
            "The variety is small.\n",
            "The waiters do not serve at the tables (you have to place the order at the counter and pick it up too).\n",
            "\"Can only\" juices.\n",
            "In general, I do not indicate. Worth the first visit to know. Only.\n",
            "We were very poorly received by the establishment's employee. We gave up and went to another restaurant. We had already gone again and we also did not have a good experience. We decided to try it again and the night was more unpleasant than the previous one. I’m never coming back and I don’t recommend it.\n",
            "Well located on the edge of Boa Viagem, the steakhouse has an excellent buffet and the waiters are very attentive\n",
            "In April I went with a friend to Côco Bambu in Recife for dinner. We were well received and as soon as we were seated the waiter served us well. The food is delicious and after a while of dinner the waiter came back to our table and asked if we like the food and I thought this attitude was great, since not every establishment is really concerned with the customer's opinion about the food and / or attendance.\n",
            "The waiting time between the order and the arrival of the meal at the table was tolerable. The values ​​of the dishes are high, but the quality of the food and the good service are worth it.\n",
            "I really liked the atmosphere and the service. We ordered fish stew and fish stew with shrimp. They were delicious, but not delicious.\n",
            "Restaurant very well decorated, great food with good cost benefit.\n",
            "Impeccable service.\n",
            "Transfer service available.\n",
            "I had a great experience with the restaurant, especially with the service. I went on a weekday that didn't have many people, a Monday. The food was great, cold drinks ... Anyway. Only the amount that is a little salty. But I enjoyed meeting you.\n",
            "Nice and reserved place with variety of foods. Of course, the flagship is Italian cuisine.\n",
            "The atmosphere is classy, ​​very pleasant and the service is very good, all very friendly and polite. I just think they sinned when my husband asked for a little more sparkling wine to finish one of his entrees that he harmonized with, and the waiter signaled that the next entrée was coming and didn't bring it. We ordered the menu with starters and two main dishes paired with wines. We liked a lot. Some entrees were more surprising, like Kimchi mini sandwich and pork belly, and crackling with oyster and caipirinha sorbet. Some entries were in the neutral, but none in the bad. I found the perfect pairing, we just don't like the dessert wine. The thousand leaves of octopus, although beautiful, were not surprising in taste, since the dishes with red meat, my husband liked them all. Even asking for the smaller menu, we left there very satisfied, there was not even space for coffee !! The price is very high, the cost benefit is not the best, but for those looking for a gastronomic experience it is worth it. I intend to return on a next visit to Rio.\n",
            "I like it very much because in addition to great food, good price, there is the wonderful catamaran ride with a bath.\n",
            "The place is nice cozy, good service. Ideal to make a reservation beforehand, as it is packed. It presents good contemporary food, but nothing extraordinary, I found the value charged high.\n",
            "I really liked the service and the atmosphere, rustic, but in good taste. The atmosphere is spacious, air-conditioned, serves a good variety of meat and has a good variety of salads.\n",
            "Excellent food and careful cheerful service. Great bleeds and divine food ... When we ordered the second egg-based dish (we were two people), the chef came to us and suggested we change the order, as there would therefore be 9 eggs for his people ... I was delighted with so much care and delicacy!\n",
            "Follow the line of the other Coco Bambu. However, there are great options for snacks, pizza, tapioca etc ... ideal for a Sunday night. The self-service style lunch during the week is excellent and with different and regional options, such as lamb, duck, panelada.\n",
            "A must-see pork knee, very friendly service despite having gone to the mothers' days (crowded), it is only the noise that gets in the way, we need to speak very loudly, I also recommend the trio of sausages.\n",
            "In addition to the very pleasant location, the face service is already enchanting. The food is always very tasty. Live ambient music leaves a light and peaceful atmosphere. Our waiter was Luiz Martins, who always smiling gave us great suggestions of the dishes, gave us attention and left us at ease.\n",
            "a simple place, totally on the sand, with tasty food, hearty food and honest price. easy access and easy parking nearby. the executive dish quietly serves 2 people who eat \"normal\". it's worth taking a little beach and having lunch here.\n",

            "Very fun and creative environment. The waitresses were all very attentive.\n",
            "There is tapioca with different fillings than we are used to, but very good !!!\n",
            "A big fly in the middle of the sauce on my plate. I just called the waiter and showed him, without scandal, because there were other people at the table and in the restaurant and I didn't want to disturb anyone's lunch. The worst was the attitude of the manager, who arrived at the table in a tone of arrogance and asked:\n",
            "- I heard you had a problem.\n",
            "I'll never be back again. Bad manager. He doesn't know how to deal with and handle this type of situation.\n",
            "Great place! I wanted to go to the Lourdes unit because it was the # 1 on TripAdvisor, but I was> 1h waiting and when I called the Anchieta Unit there were only 3 tables in front. It turned out that when I arrived I didn't even have a line! Excellent food, well served.\n",
            "We ordered artisanal sausage starter, which is good, with mustard sauce, but it can be done without. I saw that the Burrata comes out a lot but I found it a bit expensive due to its size.\n",
            "We ended up asking for a diaper, which is sold for the piece, 700g. We ordered half to the point and half to the point for good. Very tender and tasty meat! Tds comes with delicious farofa (flour + fried onion), vinaigrette and chimichurri, which are great tds. In addition you can choose between canoe potatoes, fried polenta or vegetables. We ordered half potato half polenta, but they were great! We ordered the rice bureau part which were excellent! The rice bacon is VERY yummy! There was no dessert 😳😓\n",
            "I loved the place, pleasant atmosphere and attentive service. The food is great! Super recommend if you want a meat very well done in BH! I think the Anchieta unit is a quieter place, with less queue, compared to the Lourdes unit.\n",
            "Without a doubt one of the best restaurants in Brazil, the food is excellent, but it is expensive, not accessible to everyone, but has wonderful food\n",
            "The Buffalo Steakhouse is divine. The service is very good, in addition to the barbecue with excellent cuts of meat, they have a wonderful egg farofa. There is still a sushi option on the menu.\n",
            "Pleasant place, well located. Efficient service with very attentive staff. The dishes are well served and different. Goat dishes should be tried as they are the flagship of the restaurant. There is a shuttle to hotels in the neighborhood.\n",
            "I'm a big fan of The Fifties. The burger has an atmosphere that recalls the 1950s in the USA, has delicious sandwiches, strawberry juice and milkshakes are top notch, and Brownie is the best, but lately the restaurant seems to be failing to maintain a certain regularity in its dishes. On one occasion, my girlfriend ordered the Brazilian Burguer which was super salty.\n",
            "The last time I went, Onion Burguer came with bread that crumbled a lot, very different from the others I tried earlier. Each order's Onions Rings come with a different taste or shape, or are too oily, or too small, or too dry. French fries could be less oily and more dry. And the price is very salty.\n",
            "As the title suggests ... the only thing that changed was the façade and the price that improved ... alias compatible with the pessimistic service and the uncomfortable environment ... do I recommend? ... no ... should I go back? No ... and look, I've been faxing for years that I haven't been to ... nothing has changed ... Just the side ... the food is the same as in any restaurant ... the simple barbecue ... yem that modernize. ..more humane and happy service ... after all, I am the Customer.\n",

            "\n",
            "The restaurant has a very beautiful and modern atmosphere, it is a dark green that perfectly matched the layout of the space, the lighting is ideal for a romantic dinner, it is not a Japanese restaurant for everyday life, as it is very sophisticated , I really liked the environment.\n",
            "\n",
            "The menu is very extensive, and in the beginning you end up getting lost in so many interesting things, some suggestions would be, to whet your appetite, the tuna tartare with chives, pepper, wassabi and fish eggs (R $ 35.00) competes with the rolled of rice, tuna and grilled foie gras (R $ 44.00, six units). On the hot dishes menu, red curry shrimp with coriander, pineapple and jerimum stands out, flanked by Thai garlic noodles (R $ 62.00). The dessert mix features banana sushi, petit gâteau with guava and topper roll (R $ 35.00).\n",
            "\n",
            "The wine list is very good, it has several wines from the most varied countries, and the wines are not very expensive, they range in the range of 60 ~ 70 reais, they accept that you take your wine, but charge a R $ cork fee 35.00 per bottle.\n",

            "Soon a courtesy came from the house, a Missoshiru, a soy soup with tofu, which was very good, and then I ordered a NEW STILE CEVICHE (Fish and seafood, onion, cherry tomato in leche de tigre with sriracha) (R $ 36.00) you feel the taste of each fish with the citrus spice of the ceviche, and you feel the slight spicyness of the sriracha, it was very good. And BULGARO dessert (Chocolate, red fruit coullis and whipped cream) (R $ 17.00) which are 3 small slices of a chocolate cake with a firmer and more moist consistency, with the red fruit coullis for you to season the cake and eating with the whipped cream, it was very good too. I highly recommend a visit at JoJoo.\n",
            "Very nice and quiet environment, a pity that the day I went with my girlfriend they were not serving on the upper floors. As for the portion we ordered, the k'pop trio, came in good weather and was very tasty except for the fries. Which, it seemed to me, were already fried and served cold and withered. Anyway, in general I find a good place to eat a typical Korean dish or a portion, which was our case, and spend time relaxing with friends. The price is acceptable, despite not having a wide variety but it is very valid for being close to the Santa Cruz metro station and bringing easy access to the place. I recommend, I myself have been more than 1x in this place.\n",
            "5th night and la5 we went to Yakitori which is always one of our good options. The skewers are sensational. The favorites are always asparagus with bacon and liver. Divine .... this time influenced by my son-in-law we went from shabu shabu. Well served without a doubt but very expensive. I believe that prices are driving away customers because the normally full restaurant was empty. It was us and just another table occupied.\n",
            "It is tasty, but I found it expensive, not worth the cost, it was worth the experience, atmosphere, but they need to improve the price, otherwise satisfactory!\n",

            "First class service, congratulations waiter Darley, very attentive !! Great food, cozy place !!\n",
            "I am impressed with the quality and taste of the food. I ordered a rib with tutu that is not from this world! The service was great. The atmosphere is very good. I became a customer!\n",
            "Too expensive for little shrimp. It doesn't have executive dish options, and the simplest ones are still expensive compared to other places.\n",

            "I like to have lunch in this house a couple of times a week to reduce meat consumption. Excellent vegetarian option in DF.\n",
            "The place, starting with the decoration and the aroma of cinnamon in the environment, is incredible. The wonderful service, combined with the perfect wine list. The fillet carpaccio is wonderful. I was not very lucky with my dish, as I forgot to ask the magret to come well done, but the menu is very diverse, I intend to come back again to check. As for the price, it's fair.\n",
            "Great option for those who are in the mood for a Sunday afternoon bustle in Belém. The entrance is through a small door in the Old City that almost goes unnoticed, but when you enter the bar, the animal catches. The music is very diverse, and the bar has a deck that advances over the river - hence the name Palafita. Certainly, it must be the meeting point for the beautiful ladies of Belém, such a quantity of beauties.\n",
            "Good, varied environment, live sound. some days it gets very crowded and the service drops a little. Cold draft beer and good snacks\n",
            "The food is good, but due to the poor service I will think long before I return. Order takes a long time to leave, if you are in a hurry give up, sometimes it comes back, if ordering juice without sugar comes with sugar, waiters fight among themselves, blaming each other for the mistake instead of solving. Things like that happened the 3 times I came. The potato is good, but not worth the hassle ...\n",
            "Restricted a few times in recent periods, Pizzaria Guanabara, once a popular and recommended place, has lost all its appeal. Poor service, poor quality, and in the prime spot of Leblon, surrounded by numerous options of great quality. Decadent, unfortunately for people who, like me, regularly attended Guanabara. A feather.\n",
            "The ambience of the restaurant itself is a little conflicting with his proposal. The place is very chic, with nicely dressed waiters and cloth napkins. Being a Peruvian restaurant, I missed a more Latin and relaxed atmosphere.\n",
            "We ordered the ceviches tasting, which is very worthwhile. Three different types of ceviche come in a fair amount.\n",

            "Air conditioning is good.\n",
            "But I don't go back there because of the mice.\n",
            "An ideal place for happy hour, or meeting with friends, very good, but expensive food. But anyone who appreciates differentiated treatment will find it worthwhile. The place has a room for meetings and events, air conditioned and next to the Parque Mãe Bonifácia, the climate is much cooler. There is a local front for children to play. Good choice to air your head.\n",

            "The only point I make a small criticism was in relation to the Menú (which does not present the prices of the dishes) and in my order, I ordered a dish that came with Filet Mignon. I ordered the same well done, but when I started eating I realized that almost half of it was rare. In addition, the dish was excellent.\n",
            "Very good restaurant. Pleasant and cozy atmosphere. Friendly waiters. Good quality food and well presented. Salty price. However equivalent to the level, style and quality of the restaurant. The normal desserts.\n",
            "Very tasty environment and delicious food. The gum of shrimp, the flagship of the house is spectacular and accompanied by other dishes and snacks makes the late afternoon or dinner the sin of perfect gluttony. Environment to go unhurried, usually has a waiting list.\n",

            "We were in 02 couples, we ordered a flank steak with mustard sauce and a lamb sausage (with a fantastic sauce). Then I shared a lamb sandwich with my wife (it was amazing). The extremely cold draft beer. I highly recommend it. Prices are relatively expensive. We spent a total of 360 reais.\n",

            "As soon as I arrived in Rio de Janeiro, I thought the idea was great, to eat Japanese food for an affordable and fast price, and you could still enjoy promotions and various types of sauces on the table and without delay. But lately the quality has dropped a lot. I went to the Lgo do Machado store and found everything very bad, not very fresh and weirdly colored ingredients and shoyo served in a jar (? - what a horror) and no more gergilin is served. Ginger and wasabi, you have to order it and teriyaki also served in a jar. The right thing would be to offer individually. I also found it expensive for what it has to offer. There is no more tuna koni and the promotions are always from non-classic Konis. I've tried going to other stores but the result is always the same - disappointment!\n",

Its menu is very simple and offers the best known Mexican dishes (tacos, fajitas, grilled dishes, among others). So, why choose Cozumel? My answer is in the \"work as a whole\". Starting with chef William, who has a green finger for gastronomy, and prepares delicious sauces (in addition to the house pepper sauce, which I recommend). In the last few months I have tasted several dishes, and I liked them all. I wouldn't know how to choose the most delicious. It is true that I have a predilection for vegetarian tacos, but precisely because they are vegetarian. Meat dishes, for connoisseurs, are equally tasty and well-prepared, and beer is served very cold. Another component of the work is the team. Cida usually welcomes customers with a beautiful smile and friendly words of welcome. The staff is well organized and helpful. Finally, the interior decoration is friendly, evoking the common colors and shapes of the Caribbean. On the balcony there is a panel on the wall of the neighboring building painted by a Pernambuco artist with representations of the owners of the restaurants and Spanish-speaking personalities that is worth a photo.\n",

            "Beautiful location .. But the service left something to be desired, we ordered a filet mignon with wood sauce and it was extremely salty and it was never filet mignon.\n",
            "Great to go with the family on weekends. Tasty food and very well served, in addition to the great location.\n",
            "The price is also quite fair for the quality of the dish.\n",
            "Before going to maceió, this was the place I read most about here, and it did not disappoint me, good food, fast service, and the affordable price, it is worth spending a day there, on the next corner there is an ice cream shop called delicias from the cerrado, I advise you to stop by ....\n",
            "Of the houses specializing in specialty beers in BH, despite the low variety, it is the only one that offers the most qualified labels in evidence. There are some taps, always with high quality options. Although it is possible to drink on the spot, the space is very small and does not offer any type of food. The price is above average for the same brands compared to other locations in the city. I believe that the only strong point is the \"rare\" labels.\n",
            "It is a very cozy, family-run restaurant, with a peculiar decoration, presenting dishes proposals, typically Piauí, such as Baião de dois, Maria Isabel, Carne de sol, among others, very well prepared.\n",
            "Boca bistrô is, in my opinion, the best self-service in Fortaleza for those without food restrictions. There are always many options, all delicious. The atmosphere is comfortable, and the desserts are delicious. But perhaps it is also the most expensive self service in the city.\n",
            "We visited on a Saturday for lunch. Quiet and cozy restaurant. Very polite and attentive waiter! Feijoada well served, great meat, green cabbage and farofa neat! \"Meia Feijoada\" served two people calmly. Affordable price! Great option!\n",
            "Executive lunch of filet choriso (contrafilé) with rice, farofa, salad and dessert included. Side dishes not served at the table but distributed with a waiter circulating between tables.\n",
            "Fill up at lunch. Soft and tasty meat. Uruguayan beer Norteña de liter. There is also Argentine.\n",
            "The roots is a great option for those who want tasty healthy food. It has many options of salads and vegetarian dishes.\n",
            "Very pleasant atmosphere, excellent service. The restaurant offers very typical and very tasty cuisine. It is worth knowing if you are close by.\n",
            "Nice restaurant, usually full, every day of the week. Close to cinemas on Rua Augusta and Av Paulista. tasty and original food with Brazilian and oriental touches. Be sure to try the Kratong Tong and Hua hin chicken!\n",
            "Excellent restaurant. A mix of regionalism and contemporary cuisine. I recommend the seafood dishes!\n",
            "I live in salvador, La Pasta is often visited. Without a doubt, one of the best of Salvador. The staff is very attentive and they are always very helpful when we ask for some changes in the dishes (I often add shrimp to tagliatelli and it looks amazing!).\n",
            "From the start I recommend the bruschetta, in my opinion much better than the cover, it is worth going just to eat this delight! As for the dishes, I like many, but the tagliatelli is sensational! The average range of dishes is 80 reais.\n",
            "The atmosphere is very good, super valid for a dinner for two. I highly recommend it.\n",
            "The restaurant has a pleasant atmosphere, great service and the main show of humor, you will definitely crack up laughing! I loved, I had a lot of fun\n",
            "We were at this restaurant last year for lunch. It was very close to our hotel and had a very peaceful atmosphere.\n",
            "Great atmosphere for a late afternoon, with cold beer and good cover. The shrimp bobó, which easily serves 02 people, is a good choice! Service is a little time consuming, but the final result certainly pays off!\n",
            "Carvery very well served. Shrimp of all types. Little variety of beer. As an alternative to shrimp I ate beef (picanha). Not very good price nor the meat. Transfers the customer from the hotel to the restaurant.\n",
            "I had an incredible experience at this restaurant. Best quality food. Attentive staff, always offering different options for the customer to leave satisfied. Great!\n",
            "Nice place, with simple and modern decor! The shrimp patty is divine! The \"Sertão\" salad surprised and the sauces that accompanied it were very delicious! Sicilian shrimp was a great choice: breaded and crunchy prawns accompanied by brie risotto, leeks, apricots and almonds! To conclude, tapioca ice cream sundae with guava syrup, whipped cream and paçoquinha farofa! 😋 We were attended by Dimas, who was very attentive and polite! Congratulations to the whole team!\n",
            "It has a high level of service. A very varied menu and cozy atmosphere. Prices are high for those who go for a carvery and eat little. Ideal place for those who enjoy a good barbecue.\n",
            "This location no longer exists. Another food company, from another branch is in this location.\n",
            "The bad thing is that googlemaps is also listed as a working company.\n",
            "It would be perfect if it weren't so expensive. But if you are looking to spend and want to know an incredible rotation, this is the address.\n",
            "We were prepared to spend a little more at this restaurant but it was worth the investment. We use the tents service and have lunch on site. Places like bathroom and tables very clean and organized. Tasty and surprising lunch.\n",
            "A great option for a chat with friends. With beer, shrimp, etc ... Great location.\n",
            "Located in the Pinheiros market, it is an excellent place to have craft beer and eat ceviches made with fresh fish. In addition to ceviche there are also baked goods and sandwiches. The atmosphere is very relaxed and the space is relatively small but it is possible to sit at other tables available on the market.\n",
            "Excellent service in such a pleasant environment that we even forget that we are in a mall. There are several shrimp options including some very creative dishes. My shrimp came very quickly and was warm. It wasn't bad but the taste was nothing special.\n",
            "Buffet very good for those who enjoy Arabic food, well diversified and typical, well seasoned food at a fair price. The atmosphere is very executive, tables outside and everything ... But the food pays off, very good!\n",
            "This restaurant is known for its wonderful chicken, but it also serves other meats and dishes. In particular, the cover cheese bread. Worth it.\n",
            "Cool bar, suggestive name, cool snacks, well frequented, good location, excellent for a post beach. I recommend !!\n",
            "Different dishes and very well prepared. Attentive and efficient service. Interesting desserts.\n",
            "Yummy burger but nothing out of this world. Chimichurri totally tasteless. It looks like they put dried herbs in the same hour in the oil and delivered.\n",
            "Congratulations on the service and the food.\n",
            "Well served dishes and very cold beer.\n",

            "A lot of people because the place is big and accepts groups. But ask for a draft beer and have fun !!!\n",
            "Quality self service restaurant, well located and easily accessible, well prepared barbecue, air-conditioned environment.\n",
            "Varied menu catering to all tastes. For a snack, lunch, dinner or to starve your way home after a night out. Delicious food! I love the pepperoni cheese with a special sauce!\n",

            "Really enjoyed\n",
            "The snacks are very tasty and the service is also, a negative point is the hygiene that could be better.\n",
            "Typical food for those visiting São Luis. The sun meat from file was great, the cuxá rice (with a vegetable from the vinegar land) as well and the superb cassava puree.\n",
            "I was very pleased with the bar. The staff is highly prepared to serve us, the food is excellent and the most important: the price !!\n",

            "Do not know. But after losing a trip to sector 411 I decided not to take any chances.\n",
            "Here's the tip.\n",
            "One of the most beautiful views in the world!\n",
            "But food and drinks are expensive and bad.\n",
            "The service is quite time consuming too. There are always activities at sea like SUP and banana riding. It is worth knowing for the view and cosiness of the place!\n",
            "very good, food with excellent flavors such as free-range chicken, sarapatel.buchada, I will spend hours talking about this restaurant, be sure to go and eat at this place, great cost.\n",
            "Everything very tasty and with very varied options, makes you want to eat everything! I recommend the croissant sandwich with roast beef and pesto and the almond croissant.\n",
            "An excellent top-notch restaurant, great service and great food I consider five stars and perhaps one of the best in Manaus for fish\n",
            "the restaurant sao joao is on av. madonna de fatima with a delicious meat from the sun accompanied by wonderful cooked cassava. great service, very pleasant atmosphere.\n",
            "A very good restaurant, with very tasty dishes, with very attentive waitresses, and a good price, also with live sound playing MPB at a good time so that we can listen to the music and talk at the same time.\n",
            "I recommend visiting the restaurant, a must for anyone visiting Maceió.\n",
            "A really cool option to escape traditional ice cream. You can add tops, which are sweets, cookies, berries and etc.\n",
            "Cachaçaria with pleasant atmosphere, varied menu and good beer list. However, the price of meals is higher considering other restaurants of the same level outside the mall.\n",
            "The stall has a good variety of dishes at a good cost. Some friends recommended me and now I recommend it to you.\n",
            "Good service and clean and pleasant place.\n",

            "\n",
            "The pudding is one of the best I have eaten in the city.\n",
            "The restaurant is simple, but the food is very tasty. The price is excellent, but the variety is small and the tables are glued together. The day I went it was very hot. It would give a second chance.\n",
            "In addition to a traditional restaurant in the city of Vitória, it brings with it one of the best capixabas cuisines!\n",
            "Their crab is excellent and the turkey is even better!\n",
            "Worth knowing!\n",
            "Nice place and very good service!\n",
            "the place is tasty, but the price is quite salty, about 45 per person the shrimp carvery. The dishes are delicious, but for the price it is worth going to the Camarões Restaurant.\n",
            "Do you know that restaurant that you are sure that in addition to eating well and always being surprised by the outstanding flavors, you will be welcomed in a cozy and relaxed atmosphere? These are the biggest features of the Outback network. The standard of care and quality are remarkable in any unit of the network.\n",
            "The atmosphere is very pleasant. The buffet is well diversified, with cheeses, salads and side dishes. I think, however, that they should improve the choice of breads, bringing varieties that better combine with barbecue. The service is great, I see it as a differential when compared to other steakhouses! And, the main thing: the carvery is very good, because the waiters are always passing by the table, which does not happen in some steakhouses, in the style of carvery, in São Luís. Ahhhhhhh ... And for dessert lovers, wait for the cart , in which there are good options, although they are the desserts already known here !!! Highly recommend !!!\n",
            "\"We shot in the dark and got it right !!\"\n",
            "Alaíde Botequim is specialized in dumplings, but it also has traditional portions. We tried the Alaíde (shrimp with creamy cheese), pumpkin with dried meat, cod and finished with the tutu cake (📸). All WONDERFUL ... and the service is great, super attentive.\n",

            "The restaurant, in addition to having great Italian food, good wine list, great service, has the ambience as the highlight. Extremely pleasant especially on the balcony tables. It really looks like an Italian village.\n",
            "It is worth knowing the typical scalded cuiabano after enjoying a ballad. Affordable and open until the wee hours of the morning.\n",
            "Very beautiful and pleasant environment.\n",
            "Standard service.\n",
            "Plentiful, good, but expensive food, for a dinner for 4 people we paid an astronomical bill (2 bottles of wine, 1 octopus starter with sun-dried tomatoes, prawns with lemon risotto and abadejo with vegetables and rice, some waters) and we didn't even choose lobster which is one of the most expensive dishes.\n",
            "I've been to restaurants with more elaborate dishes and more sophisticated ingredients for that price.\n",
            "A little frustrating.\n",
            "At first I thought it was a little confusing with no explanation of how the place worked, but I ended up asking some of the waiters the scheme is by weight and there is a lot of variety in both food and dessert, good food at a fair price but it is a more stripped where you sit at the table with other people, there is a delay in the service for requesting a drink but it is still worth knowing for the very tasty typical foods\n",
            "This is an excellent restaurant, which I always insist on going to when I'm in Fortaleza. It offers many options of dishes including from pizzas to Filet Mignon, which was the most recent order.\n",
            "The atmosphere is not sophisticated, open, therefore, without air conditioning and, at lunchtime it can become uncomfortable.\n",
            "The steaks are wonderful.\n",

            "I recommend\n",
            "My husband took me out to dinner on my birthday and as soon as I entered, I thought: what a charming, charming and cozy place. Who attended us was Fabiana (note thousand, attentive, polite, patient and very friendly). We ordered starters (bruschettas - sensational), main courses (duck risotto and octopus risotto - perfect), we had a wine and dessert. Very pleasant experience. I highly recommend it.\n",
            "Famous breaded onion, which should be accompanied by a 700ml draft beer mug (with ice flakes, just below the collar) (a little heavy at the beginning, but unique!).\n",
            "Good and typical food from the region, very tasty, the cost benefit is very interesting. I recommend everyone to know this restaurant and I intend to return.\n",

            "Delicious main course. Great location inside the Jockey, very cozy atmosphere, very friendly waiters.\n",
            "We went at night and with rain, the strangest thing is the lack of a themed decoration like the name, almost no reference to Dali. I didn't think it was beautiful, the view must be beautiful, during the day the feathers and the windows were dirty, typical of the sea. The food is nothing special. Pretty regular\n",
            "It manages to bring together in one place sophistication, quality, service and excellent infrastructure. It has great atmosphere, excellent convenience, great place for snacks and coffee, excellent restaurant and also a place for that good French bread. It has free parking.\n",
            "I've been to Canaille many times and it's one of my favorites here in the neighborhood. The restaurant is unpretentious, with a huge wine list (for all tastes and budgets) and the food is always delicious. The sommelier always has great wine recommendations and the staff is very friendly.\n",
            "Positive point: they serve filter water, which I think is very nice and fair not to charge for water.\n",
            "good atmosphere, beautiful place, great and quality food, wonderful cost benefit I will definitely be back\n",
            "Very cozy restaurant and very good food. Highlight for the attendance of the Junior waiter, besides being friendly, it is a show apart. Congratulations on the efficient employee\n",

            "We try to get to know Chef Heaven's food after watching the gastronomic competition on television and always think that his dishes were the best. To our delight, we not only love everything we eat but the kind and attentive service of the entire team. Beautiful surroundings, delicious food and honest prices. My cavaquinha risotto was to be eaten praying. Other family members tried other options on the menu and everyone left satisfied.\n",
            "Very well located, it caters for those who leave the beach, who want to have dinner, who want to have lunch with friends. Any situation. Very tasty food! Pleasant atmosphere and a varied mouth-watering menu.\n",
            "What impressed me most was the rudeness to which I was treated by the foreign partner. Although the pizza is reasonable, the service is hateful. I don't recommend it, I won't be back ...\n",
            "Cool atmosphere, great variety of sushi and temakis, customer loyalty system, average prices, however, the price of the carvery could be revised. In addition, it is among the best in the city in the field of Japanese food.\n",
            "One of the best in Italian food in Porto Velho .. without a doubt ...\n",
            "it leaves something to be desired in the service ... and in the space ... for being small, the tables were almost on the street and with that some beggars arrived at the tables ... now it has expanded ... it has improved ...\n",
            "My experience was exceptional. Beautiful place, super cozy and intimate. We were well received and the service was attentive from start to finish. Each plateau that reaches the month is explained. Clean menu. Each mouthful is an explosion of flavors. We love our experience and have already planned the return.\n",
            "The atmosphere is very good, both for families and friends. The menu offers a wide variety of iced teas and sandwiches. Certainly the highlight is the lamb sandwich, but there are great options for complete meals. The big difference is the cold drinks, including teas, juices and lemonades. It is worthwhile both the Goiânia shopping and Flamboyant units.\n",
            "Wonderful food, very well prepared, varied and balanced menu, pleasant atmosphere and impeccable service!\n",
            "Full buffet service of farm food with dessert included, there is also barbecue and pasta, but the service at the tables is very slow,\n",

            "\n",
            "I just didn't give 5 stars, because the drink (in the case of water), was served in a plastic cup. It could have been in a glass. In addition to being visibly better at drinking, it is more environmentally friendly!\n",
            "As always great service and delicious dishes. I recommend the cod croquette and Spanish cod. Right order!\n",
            "For those who want to have fun without the vain illusion of the right payment, this is the place. Fair price. The tip is not to ask for the climb bracelet on arrival. First feel the weather, and if you think it's worth it, then ask for the climb bracelet.\n",
            "Delicious hamburgers and a huge list of special beers for every taste! We left there super satisfied and with a taste for more !!! Congratulations guys.\n",
            "Good food, pleasant atmosphere, good service, good location and reasonable price. Highly recommended!\n",

            "\n",
            "I recommend.\n",
            "I liked the service more than the food. I went twice, once for dinner and once for lunch. At dinner, I ordered Torta Capixaba and Caranguejos. I liked them both, and the service was so good that I decided to return the next day for lunch. I ordered a Moqueca with shrimp, and the fish seemed to taste strange. My wife was unable to eat, but I liked it after all. Good values, and maybe I'll come back. Additional detail is that there is a wall full of pictures with famous people (Gianechini, Thiago Lacerda, Heloisa Perisse, Eva Wilma, Bruno Gagliasso, among others), that is, it is renowned.\n",
            "No frills place, lean menu but well suited.\n",

            "Newest Subway store in town. It has large parking and easy access. The service is still awkward, but over time it should improve.\n",
            "Whenever I am in POA I do not miss going to Takêdo at least once, the last time I had dinner there twice on the 3 days I stayed in the city (lol). The ambience of the place of great taste, wonderful food (I recommend the Oyster Sauce Ebi and the Volcano !!) and exceptional service from the waiter Soledad, always very attentive and kind, completed a very pleasant evening watered by a De Martino Gallardía Rosé that harmonized perfectly with all dishes. I will always return to Takêdo when I am in POA!\n",
            "A place with a different decoration (in each space) and very interesting frequented by cute people. The food is good and so is the music. You may want more. A must go @ Rio de Janeiro.\n",
            "Met her today. Pleasant atmosphere, bistrot type, attentive and polite service. And the food, wonderful. Creative salads, hot dishes ditto. It had ceviche, guacamole, oxtail and polenta, chicken ... Juice, water, dessert, coffee included. And the killer price: R $ 30.00. If it were at Padre Chagas they would be charging R $ 50.00. It is very worth it, I will be the right customer!\n",

            "Huge restaurant, with excellent buffet system, avoiding queues, huge variety of food, fruits and sweets in addition to barbecue. A little expensive for this type of restaurant but it is worth it.\n",
            "It's all good for a quick snack and for lunch too. The sfiha has no comparison! And the kafta with lentil rice is also delicious, with excellent cost benefit!\n",
            "The space is spacious and cozy..well in the outback style, with tables for happy hour. It is usually full, but it is worth the wait. Excellent quality food.\n",

            "Sensational hamburger, has craft beers, wines. Accompanied by rustic potatoes. Service is great, but it is always packed and waiting! The price is very salty, the average price for a hamburger is 30 to 35 reais, but it is worth it!\n",

            "Pleasant atmosphere, great service and excellent food. And the restaurant manager explains a lot about the local cuisine. Making us travel and get to know Peruvian culture. I highly recommend it.\n",
            "Madero de Fortaleza achieved a standard of excellence, I followed from the beginning and I could see the evolution of the dishes. The Madero bacon and the choripan were delicious, the bread was very crispy, congratulations to the staff and I highly recommend it.\n",
            "Excellent restaurant, with a rich and complete cuisine in seafood. Impeccable service, attentive waiters and warm atmosphere\n",
            "I really liked Dom Camaleone, the pizza is tasty, well frequented, good service. It is possible to celebrate in separate environments, you have to book in advance. Good prices too.\n",
            "Small on the outside, but big on the inside. Reasonable service. Difficult place to park. Mexican food. You have to take care of the pepper.\n",
            "Honest self-service, fresh and good food, efficient service, is well worth the visit.\n",
            "Parking is small, but it is possible to park on the street next door, which is a major inconvenience.\n",
            "We will definitely be back.\n",
            "In addition to the well-drawn draft beer, there was a variety of snacks.\n",

            "Very attentive waiters.\n",
            "It is a good restaurant, with a pleasant atmosphere and good food, within the Sport Club Recife. It is good to avoid Sport match day in Recife.\n",
            "Think of a nice restaurant ... The service is something that catches our attention: the owners of the restaurant serve together with the waiters, giving suggestions of dishes and lavishing sympathy. I love La Taperia\n",
            "Great atmosphere, very well decorated and cozy. Attentive waiters, organized menu, well presented and tasty dishes! I recommend!!\n",
            "Tacaca is typically northern Brazilian food. D. Maria's is very famous, but I found it normal like many others in the city. The stall is located in the middle of the street and has no comfort, the service is good too.\n",
            "The restaurant is well located and close to the coastal road where most hotels are located. The food is regional. I highlight the cheese mush.\n",
            "Menu with several options. I ordered a simple dish, but it was tasty. I recommend the place, because besides the food being delicious, the atmosphere is pleasant with good service.\n",

            "We have been to Primeli Bistrô many times. It is one of our favorite restaurants. The staff are very attentive, the atmosphere is very cozy and the food is delicious.\n",
            "Here are some suggestions, based on the various visits to the establishment:\n",

            "I ate a pork rib with tea sauce (what a sauce!) And my wife ordered a soup. Everything was very good, and the service was grade 10.\n",
            "I took a pink Gin Tonica that I don't know what was inside, but it was excellent!\n",
            "I want to go now just to taste the teas, which are the specialty of the house.\n",
            "This buffet system is not worth it, parts are exposed for hours and who knows what time they were made (by the most likely aspect the previous day). Invest in a rotation where pieces are made exclusively for you. Bad service, waiter is on top pressing you to choose the drink; hot beer; there is no shrimp item on the buffet ... beeeeem fallen!\n",
            "I went with my husband on a Monday night, through a promo from Peixe Urbano.\n",
            "We arrived at 19h and the place was practically empty.\n",
            "The service was as expected with a view to having us and another table to serve. The waiters were helpful in the service, always around picking up from the table what would no longer be used.\n",
            "The place is small and pleasant.\n",
            "The food was good, the carvery was served fast and the repetitions too. However, I emphasize that the movement was calm, so everything was as expected.\n",
            "The temaki was not good, the seaweed was mushy and moist, it did not look and taste fresh. The salmon was very \"crushed\" and \"sticky\" with cream cheese, it looked like a pasted paste, which I didn't like at all, so much so that I didn't even eat it.\n",
            "Some items in the combo didn't look fresh to me.\n",
            "The calamari dorê was divine, crispy and fried on the spot. Delicious shimeji and grilled salmon too!\n",
            "Overall my experience at this restaurant was grade 7. For the amount paid it was worth it.\n",
            "As I have been to other Japanese restaurants closer to my residence and I have other references, I can say that Kitakami is not the best and would not be a return option.\n",
            "In particular, it is not a restaurant that is worth the commute given the distance.\n",
            "But I recommend the experience to others.\n",
            "Well located, modern, cool, half light, trendy place, well frequented, good service, fair price, cozy, good food, but I thought it could be better, it was not surprising, but the visit is valid for the whole, super recommended.\n",
            "I really like to stop for a mate and have a cheese bread at Rei do Mate. I recommend it to anyone who passes by.\n",
            "hamburger disappointed a little, I expected more, but it was, the hunger paid off, the mayonnaise is very creamy, the service was efficient and there was a parking lot next door.\n",
            "So much cheese, so much cheese, so much cheese. The food took 40 minutes to arrive and as we sat on the edge, beggars spend all the time. In the other dishes, it seems that they are perfect in the accompaniment, but the meat comes TOO SMALL.\n",
            "Manga Food Truck is a very nice place, with several food trucks around a mango tree.\n",
            "There are several meal options. It has snacks on French bread, Thai food, regional food, risottos, Japanese food, pasta, as well as a variety of sweets and craft drinks.\n",
            "I really enjoyed it and recommend it.\n",
            "I consider myself a beer drinker and was pleased to see service arrive with refills. Some users are aggressive, but I love this type of service. The foam in the beer was more like a cappuccino - which surprisingly left the beer underneath. It seems the co2 was on top instead of pearling inside the beer. A mediocre beer, but at least cold and good food.\n",
            "\n",
            "Large local crowd, I liked the music, too. I ordered a fillet which was unfortunately too much and I had to go early to eat before it went cold. Perhaps a heated plate that helped.\n",
            "\n",
            "I don't speak Portuguese, however, I found the staff helpful.\n",

            "Karu's ambience already conquers you right on arrival with his lamps hanging from the ceiling and across the back wall. Very cozy and with great service, Karú brings a contemporary authorial proposal, based on Brazilian cuisine. The tasting menu is a journey of flavors that is worth trying. Like any kitchen signed by a chef, here is a place to delight.\n",
            "The hamburger has a salty price, but the size and quality is in the price.\n",
            "It is so tasty that it is worth every caloric bite.\n",
            "The service was great, as it was our first time the waiter made some suggestions and got them all right.\n",
            "The restaurant was very full and we had no reservation so we sat at a table that got some sun which was a little unpleasant.\n",
            "Would go back.\n",
            "One of the best ribs I've ever eaten.\n",
            "Very juicy and great seasoning.\n",
            "A must for anyone coming to BH.\n",
            "Very pleasant atmosphere and good service from employees.\n",
            "Price compatible with what is offered.\n",
            "The food is very good, in reality I didn't think I would like it, but after dinner I felt like going back, because the atmosphere is interesting and engaging, the food is tasty and the service is very helpful, the food is fantastic\n",
            "They should be ashamed of serving food to the public. I ate the worst salmon in my life. Horrible vegetables. Nothing had salt. Rice and\n",
            "We had lunch before checking out and we were very well attended and the food was wonderful. There is also a very tasty breakfast served in these restaurants, with many options and even tapioca and omelettes made to order. Worth knowing!!!\n",
            "Very old and traditional place in Porto Velho, it has the best fish in the city. it is a place where a first-rate structure or finish is not expected, but it is worth it for the taste.\n",
            "The sandwich and the cold beer were perfect on the day I visited this restaurant, the service was very attentive, the place was cozy and very pleasant, the sandwiches we ordered came well presented, delicious and very generous in size, worth the cost-benefit.\n",
            "We love it! Excellent food and very good service!\n",
            "We ate some ceviches that were divine!\n",
            "Not to mention the owner Simone q is very polite and friendly, as well as the whole team.\n",
            "It is very worth it !!\n",
            "Perini's options are always good. I stopped for dinner at the Buffet and really liked the variety at a fair price. Highlight for the Tapioca porridge.\n",
            "The park's snack bar has almost everything to kill the hungry sandwiches.bauru good buffet service good juices made to order honest price\n",
            "Very good restaurant! Buffet at noon, very varied (with salmon, pirarucu, hide and seek, fillet and lamb scallops, pasta, salads, cod, etc.). Great service. The restaurant is at the Victoria Plaza Hotel, but oddly enough, guests have to pay the bill on the spot, you can't put it on your room bill! And the breakfast is not so good. The omelet was cold at 7 am!\n",
            "Very good, not cheap. Stripped house, with a lot of Rock and good music.\n",
            "Great meat, without accompaniment.\n",
            "Among the best hamburgers in SP.\n",
            "Without comfort\n",
            "Good and always warm food, clean and decent place. Well frequented by workers in the city center.\n",
            "We were at this Tapiocaria located in Ponta Negra. Rustic style, details in the decoration of baskets on the roof, crochet panel, clay wall and tables on the sand. I loved the tapioca stuffed with fresh coconut and covered with coconut milk. Delicious. I intend to return to try the others.\n",
            "Wonderful food, selected environment, perfect service, fair price, in short, everything leads me to return whenever possible\n",
            "The atmosphere is very cozy, the view is sensational, but the best is the taperebá draft beer! It's just delicious! One of the best I've ever had! There is also açai, bacuri and prioprioca beer (the best after the taperebá beer). Unique experience!\n",
            "Both the Campo Grande mall unit and the Afonso Pena unit have terrible service, untrained and unprepared professionals to serve customers.\n",
            "Despite having a great açaí, I will not return because the service leaves something to be desired.\n",
            "Delicious food and first class service in a comfortable environment ... not to mention free parking. A shrimp dish serves two people abundantly and the price range is around 90,100 reais per dish. Worth checking out, I highly recommend it!\n",
            "This was the most fun outback I've ever been .. The waiters are very excited and helpful, When it comes to singing the congratulations they are super excited .. Wonderful food .. I loved it and highly recommend it.\n",
            "I go to the restaurant a lot. I recommend the salads and veggie dishes. Excellent salmon with avocado and cauliflower risotto. I recommend for fresh and light food. It's not cheap, but it's worth it.\n",
            "The place is small but very cozy. Plenty of beer options. You have the option to stay inside the bar or on the sidewalk. Very cool is right in the center.\n",
            "Good dish, but nothing surprising. The two-person portion comes with little food. If you're hungry, you'll need to ask for something else.\n",
            "With the outdoor space, it is now much more comfortable. Even more so on the hottest days.\n",
            "The snacks are very good, but the cheese sfiha, for example, leaves something to be desired.\n",
            "Great place to relax with friends\n",
            "Very popular restaurant in the locality. I asked some people on the street about a good restaurant and they told me about this place.\n",
            "I recommend. The food is good, very tasty, I really liked it.\n",
            "The price I found very affordable.\n",
            "The service is very familiar, very friendly people.\n",
            "Great atmosphere, great food and drinks! Delicious place to have a leisurely lunch, beating bato and going in the afternoon for a house beer or one of the delicious drinks!\n",
            "I love 1008, the food is excellent and always comes in large quantities. The 2 restaurants maintain the same quality and the price is good. It is only difficult to get a table, but it is part of it, the good thing is to go early so as not to be in the waiting line. Whoever comes to Goiânia, find a way to go and enjoy some sunny meat.\n",
            "Super nice atmosphere and great service. Quality açaí and the soup then became my best friend.\n",
            "Nice atmosphere and great food ... Fish and seafood ideal for any occasion.\n",
            "Everything very fresh and delicious seasoning.\n",
            "I really like this pizzeria, because the price is very affordable. Also, the attendants are great! The pizza dough is very crispy and wonderful!\n",
            "Lotus is located in the bustling Ponta Negra neighborhood! The restaurant has a modern and pleasant decor divided into different environments! The restaurant staff are very friendly and always willing to serve you very well! The menu is very varied, prevailing Japanese cuisine, with sushi, sashimi, combined, among others, always presented with great care! It tastes wonderful! There are other options for starters, ceviche and hot dishes! There is also the option of Kids dishes, which I consider to be a concern of the restaurant, so much so that the place is well frequented by couples with children! The desserts are delicious, with options of petit gateau, brownie, among others! There is no on-site parking, but there is the presence of a restaurant security guard who guides customers on arrival! The ideal is to arrive early and the restaurant opens at 7pm, every day, except on Monday! It is worth checking!\n",
            "Whenever I want a beautiful feijoada it is the Badaró that I look for! The table that serves the feijoada, you choose what you want to eat, part by part, and a special highlight for bacon, which is a temptation. Seasoning on the spot, always everything very well prepared and served. It makes your mouth water !!!\n",
            "The pizza is delicious and the place is well structured for family and friends. Live music and more.\n",
            "We were in the market today and were able to try the most varied fish and crustaceans with affordable prices and freshly prepared. A delight!\n",
            "The layout of the place is: you buy fresh fish in one stall and take it to another stall to fry, steam or even make a stew. The fry costs about R $ 10.\n",
            "The downside is that there are a lot of beggars circulating around the clock and they pick up the scraps they leave on the plates. Very sad and unpleasant. Also be aware that it is a dangerous region, with small recurring thefts. Get there by taxi or uber, it's safer.\n",
            "Despite being an old place and located in a region that has a deep relationship with the origins of this city, I always had the feeling that this space could be better used in the opportunities that I was there. Despite being a simple environment, it is no longer acceptable to use plastic over a cloth towel to cover the tables. One gets the feeling that the expedient is to save on cleaning, thus compromising the health of users. The white chairs look like they haven't been washed in a while. And the bathroom, then, is not even mentioned, a real pigsty. On March 15, 2013, I went to have a beer there with my wife. She ate a regional dish, with shrimp, crab and other things. It cost 23 reais. Reasonable. Later, I ordered a portion of chips for myself. Price: 25 reais. That's right, a regional dish, with ingredients imported from other states came out cheaper than the portion of potatoes. A real challenge aimed at the consumer. I don't go back to that place in those conditions anymore.\n",
            "Very good!\n",
            "In fact it is a complex just like the others located on the beach of the future.\n",
            "Children's pool, massage, affordable prices, delicious food.\n",
            "We ordered a squid from Dorê huuuummmm ...\n",
            "\n",
            "The only thing that bothers are street vendors. There are so many that if you decide to stay on the beach, you can't even talk so much that they disturb you.\n",
            "I loved it and will probably go back there! Delicious regional food, first class service and a pianist doing the ambient soundtrack! The value of the free buffet (lunch) is R $ 40.00 including dessert. The restaurant is located in a very well kept historic mansion. Super nice in all aspects. I recommend.\n",
            "Excellent restaurant. Cozy atmosphere, fast service, wonderful food, live music and very polite staff.\n",
            "Good service, although I think there is a lack of waiters, but nothing that gets in the way, live music a little loud but also not uncomfortable, paradise beach, good food, cold beer and prices within the expected for an environment designed for tourism (eg. , Itaipava 600ml to 8 reais). You pay 25 reais to enter and enjoy the good structure. I repeat the tip of some people: arrive early to get a deck chair facing the sea. We arrived around 9:30 am and we didn't make it, only later because it rained and scared some people and it was already close to closing time.\n",
            "Particularly I didn't find anything extraordinary, the service, yes, this is above average, but the food was reasonable, maybe because it is from the Serra Gaucha, it is difficult to find a food that surpasses that of the south! But overall it is worth checking out!\n",
            "We went in a group of friends who already knew. I already knew fame but I was surprised. I am not a fan of pasta, but from the starter to the dessert you live a journey of wonderful flavors. I ordered the burrata stuffed ravioli with parma ham and arugula. Simply divine !!!\n",
            "I went on a Thursday, I arrived at 19:30. There was already a 30-minute wait. It has an area next to it with a bar and tables also reserved for waiting. At first I was disappointed to wait but we ordered a few drinks at the bar, the place is so pleasant that I don't even have time to spend. Advice: if it is Friday or Saturday be prepared to wait or arrive early !!!\n",
            "Very amazing, great food and super cold beer. Loved the service, very polite staff and requests. Manager Amaro Rocha show\n",
            "Cozy place, serves good wines and the famous Sergipe moqueque. I liked the place, a wonderful sole.\n",
            "The service is the same as other restaurants they have everything note 10 all friendly enough attentive best Christmas restaurant\n",
            "when ordering a shrimp dummy, I found the price reasonable, when I received the order I realized that the amount of food does not satisfy an adult person. I left hungry and realized that the cost benefit is very bad. Not to mention the lack of seasoning on the dish. I won't go back there\n",
            "typical restaurant with regional food ... unpredictable for those who wear João Pessoa\n",
            "super nice and thematic environment\n",
            "I went to lunch with some co-workers and the experience was so bad that I don't even know where I can start ...\n",
            "The waiters were visibly in a hurry; when finishing the order, one of them practically \"took\" the menu from our hands. The food was extremely oily; one of the dishes had to be changed because it was raw, while another took a long time to arrive.\n",
            "At the time of payment, this information was passed on to a responsible person who was at the register, and it was rude; with a changed voice he said that people who frequent the restaurant at lunchtime are always in a hurry and that is why they are not always able to please everyone. We weren't in a hurry and made that very clear, but she just kept trying to refute our arguments.\n",
            "Expensive and oily food, poor service and rudeness. I'll never be back!\n",
            "The external beauty of the building is surprising, but as soon as you enter there is no way to be spellbound! Old house decorated with care and very green, various environments, pleasant lighting (natural or not), kindness of the attendants: there is no better start than this! The cover with artisanal breads is simple but tasty and has the constant attention of the waiters: the bread basket is replaced numerous times in order to be always full and warm. The dishes are well done, the sauces are delicious and the pasta is impeccable \"al dente\". A wide choice of desserts makes choosing difficult. I opted for the \"toasted\" cream with pistachios and, I confess, I was disappointed :( The presentation is beautiful and the texture of the cream is fantastic, smooth and very delicate but there was an extra hint of vanilla and sugar (personal taste, of course). my first visit and it certainly won't be my last!\n",
            "The place is simple, there are tables on the sidewalk ideal for warmer days. The stew is good, the one for two people serves three, even with an urban fish voucher we didn't feel any difference in service. Value with veal of the stew was around R $ 60.00.\n",
            "I really liked the place, I visited this month only 6 times! I was well attended by Iraci, Joelma, Cosme and Alisson.\n",
            "I loved the place, excellent service, snacks and super tasty snacks! I highly recommend Chicken Wings with mustard sauce, spectacular!\n",
            "The Restaurant is in the Fish Market which is neat and very cool. I recommend the curd cheese with honey.\n",
            "The exquisite service has always captivated me since the first time, so much so that I live next to Le Vin at Praça Vilaboin but I insist on going to Morumbi. Mr. Hélio always offers wonderful suggestions for new wines, and welcomes us as if we were at his home. I'm a fan of shrimp risotto and salmon with lemon foam. Simply divine!\n",
            "This restaurant is a delight. As a name already says Portuguese restaurant. It serves delicious cod. It has great service. And parking. Salty price. But watch\n",
            "I thought it was very expensive for what it offers, they brought a sequence of suggestions from the waiter and the sashimi came with pepper sauces, I was with my 7 year old son and he had a burning mouth and the worst thing is that he loves and really wanted to eat, to wait until it comes to the customer's taste.\n",
            "Pleasant atmosphere, very few tables. We ordered an Arancini starter which came cold, the Crostini also cold soft bread nothing crunchy.\n",
            "We arrived at the table with a table with 5 people, it took a long time to arrive and when they arrived they forgot to ask for my Fettuccine carbonaria. Being a small place, with a reservation ... I was really upset. Although again ... I will not be returning again.\n",
            "We tried the new option for pizza at a price a little cheaper than the top brand in Brasilia (Francesca). The pasta was on point and the ingredients were very good (shitake and portuguese). It is very difficult to maintain the quality of tele-pizza, but it is always good to honor the competition to have this facility on a family night.\n",
            "I love Press's cappuccino, for me it's the best of POA, the sea bass fillet is also great, as well as the salads. Ideal place for a happy hour, but very good for a meal too.\n",
            "Excellent pizza, air-conditioned place great service delicious pizza, great playground for kids and safe.\n",
            "Restaurant of great quality, pleasant sound, ambience too. A wide variety of dishes and each one better than the other. It is worth every moment and dish.\n",
            "I met a great friend at Z Café do Iguatemi, in Porto Alegre. Always full and with good service, we got a table. The pineapple, orange and strawberry juice is delicious, at 11 reais. The gorgonzola and spinach quiche is very tasty. A great order after shopping. There are many other possibilities on the menu. I recommend!\n",
            "It has varied options for quick meals or snacks. Offers a corner adapted to welcome pets that accompanies the client.\n",
            "I've been there a few times and every time I leave, I wonder why it is among the best. The atmosphere is great, the service is impeccable, but the food is not that loud.\n",
            "I went to a family lunch, everything was very tasty, but I spent 1 hour and 15 to get our orders, I had to complain to the waiter, I think I should have more respect for the customer\n",
            "The food is very good, well served!\n",
            "The wonderful Bisteca!\n",
            "Simple and cozy atmosphere!\n",
            "Waiters and service Excellent!\n",

            "I was ashamed of my friends for suggesting this restaurant. And it is a pity that he is one of the rare Thai people in Sao Paulo and that he certainly will not survive. The menu has good options for Thai and Indochina dishes, but the main ingredients, shrimp, squid and pineapple, were gone. In fact, the water was also gone. They could have warned on the phone or at least closed the doors before we entered. A very improvised dinner and in the end the manager offered a 20% discount as compensation. It turns out that this discount would already be entitled for a restaurant agreement with a bank or with the restaurant.\n",
            "We ordered a dish that we saw on the next table but ours came much smaller. We ended with a cold and undercooked petit gateau and a bad coffee. And all this on the side of the wine cellar, scoring 24 degrees.\n",
            "A wonderful option for the late afternoon at the edge of the lagoon. Be sure to go when you have it in Rio. Several drink options. Lying on a hammock or on a restaurant sofa, looking at the view of the lagoon is sensational.\n",
            "Simple restaurant, however, leaves something to be desired. Highlight for the quality food and very good service!\n",

            "The location is pleasant; the problem is that the air conditioning evaporators are poorly positioned and end up blowing cold air directly on certain tables. There are few options for dishes, well executed. The grills are great, always with a choice of sauce and two side dishes. For a quick meal, savory pies are good, too. Difficult to choose which sweet pie, among so many good options.\n",
            "Place for families, always full, the dishes arrive super fast, cold beer and the toy library is huge, has toys for all ages, just needed monitors.\n",

Waitstaff polite and ready to serve you with the utmost promptness. I recommend with my eyes closed, especially the \"Entre Amigos\" of Beira Mar de Boa Viagem. The price is a little bit salty, but worth what you eat.\n",
            "Located in the bar near Pepe beach. Reasonable option of Japanese food, but without being dazzled. The service is good, but other than that I didn't see any difference.\n",
            "Rustic and cozy atmosphere, with the theme of the writer Bukowski.\n",
            "The drink list is good, with several options, including some by the bar (I recommend these). However, in terms of snacks it is quite limited.\n",
            "Another aspect that left something to be desired was the service. The waiters are not at all attentive, with the exception of Marjore (I think that's how you spell it) who gave good tips on drinks.\n",
            "Prices are fair.\n",
            "I'm sure that those who eat come back to Bob's skewer because the food is very good and with good service!\n",

            "I had a great experience with this restaurant, I went twice in the 3 days I stayed in São Luís. Great food, very well served, several options of meat and seafood. The price is not the cheapest, but it pays off the investment. Good service and delicious pastries.\n",

I highlight the ancho steak and also the wide variety of salads along with some hot dishes. It is worth the cost benefit at lunch time.\n",
            "the reasonable location, the very small closed area with a very large mold smell and the outside area, I found a lot on the street, without a children's area, the good food ...

            "Despite not having a privileged location in Belém, the fish backwater is perhaps the most traditional place to eat fish in Belém, highlighting the curd cheese cake with tapioca I thought I wouldn't eat a curd cheese cake with tapioca better than Rodrigo do Mocotó in São Paulo but believe me it’s better. I recommend the uncooked smoked pirarucu paraense moqueca, you will find that it is in heaven, the service is polite and helpful, and the restaurant has several awards for the 4-wheel guide and for the magazine see mandatory stop in Belém.\n",

            "It is a pity that it is located half hidden and so not everyone knows this place so delicious! The owner and his children serve customers with such affection that we feel welcomed, at home! The order was noted in Arabic !! The food is fresh, delicious, all freshly made and, as they explain, they are served the way they are made in Syria. The price is right and the dishes well served. At the time of leaving, we were also presented with a piece of candy by the owner. It was a delicious lunch experience.\n",
            "We went to Nikkei for lunch today. We chose the rodizio where the dishes were brought according to the attendant's choice. He served us the dishes that had the most output. It was a good choice because we enjoyed almost all the dishes listed in the command, and of course, we repeated some.\n",
            " The service is another point to highlight. Upon our arrival, we were served by Mr. Maurício, who introduced us to the services and forms of service, the dishes were chosen by Mr. Bili.\n",
            "An interesting point is the menu, which already has indications for people who have allergies. They are symbols that indicate the type of ingredient that is used in the dish. At the beginning of the services I informed that I was allergic to shrimp and Mr. Bili - always very attentive and helpful - presented us with the served dish and warned about the existence or not of the shrimp. In addition to the food, we had the opportunity to contemplate a beautiful view of Lake Paranoá on a beautiful sunny day as well as listening to a refined musical repertoire.

            "The restaurant is one of those that you can go to lunch every day and does not get sick of so many options. The barbecue meat is of high quality, sushi, salads, desserts, and compared to other cities, the price is great.\n",

            "We always go in the outback and we like the food, but the service is not always good, today was below reasonable. We were with the family to celebrate my husband's birthday and we couldn't eat together. My in-laws' dish came wrong, but they ate anyway ... but my meat dish came out rare and I asked for the spot and my sister-in-law's dish didn't come, she ate when everyone was finished. The manager came to explain, but only after my brother-in-law insisted a lot ... he was attentive, but what good is it after so much out of service ... the desire is not to come back ...\n",
            "Place has been renovated. It is more modern. Colorful and new chairs. Environment with air conditioning etc. However, the layout of the sofas was not very functional and the quality of the food fell. For those who prefer delivery services, food packaging for travel is better\n",

            "Parrilla del Sur is a place of extremes. Surely you will have excellent cuts of meat there, like entrecot or chorizo ​​steak, but you can also get frustrated because you may not find a simple \"morcilla dulce\". The dishes are well presented and some even serve two people depending on the hunger of the customer, but all require accompaniment and as these are not included, Parrilla del Sur requires prior planning before being visited so that you don't burst your pocket.\n",
            "Frustration can also appear in an oversight in the preparation of the dish that only noticed the table (as it happened on 07/02/2016), promptly repaired but that could have been avoided. The service is friendly and the atmosphere is pleasant, although sometimes it takes time to realize that the air conditioning should already be on. I still recommend it, but take it easy when making your choices.\n",

            "We went on a Saturday night, took a queue of about two hours, but it was worth it, wonderful food, cold beer, and exceptional service. It was a great experience, well worth it. But you have to arrive early ...\n",
            "Very simple restaurant, but with very tasty homemade food and a reasonable price. Located in the Boa Vista neighborhood.\n",
            "We ordered a ravioli that the sauce came hot but the filling was cold! We ask you to come back! And we returned the same dish heated in the microwave. I couldn't eat! We left! The grated cheese looked like flour.\n",

            "We will be back for sure\n",
            "at the entrance of the restaurant a horrible smell of sewage, inside ... nothing much different. Poor service, bad and very greasy food. It is not because it is Northeastern food that needs to be greasy ..... Honestly it was the second and terrible experience. I won't be back.\n",
            "Detail, what they offer is too expensive\n",
            "Great variety at a fair price. Large lounge, with a free buffet or kilo option. The Japanese kilo buffet is different.\n",
            "I really enjoyed eating at this restaurant on my visit to Belém. I even came back the next day. Tip is the stew.\n",
            "Go with curiosity to know new flavors, taste what you already know and observe the decoration of the place. Beautiful and spacious, Mangai is a must-see for Natal, João Pessoa and Brasília.\n",
            "The desserts are great! I recommend eating a little bit of everything: D\n",
            "The dishes: snake suvaco, cassava lasagna, salmon with capers, sun-dried meat, mommy rice let me go, roasted rennet cheese and garlic and oil shrimp cannot be missed. It's worth eating at Mangai! Apart from stuffed tapioca, hominy, mush, manioc bread on the plate ... delicious.\n",
            "I liked it and approved! go you too! cold beer with great options of snacks and dishes, I liked the fish bait.\n",

            "Very nice place, besides offering many options of snacks, drinks and various foods !! Congratulations!\n",
            "The evaluation goes to the Self-Service portion of the restaurant, as there is a lounge for \"a la carte\" service.\n",
            "My wife and I went to the restaurant today, as we are regular customers from other units.\n",
            "When we arrived, one side of the buffet was inaccessible apparently due to cleanliness. I understand the need for cleaning, but access to food has been hampered. Some people went around the buffet to have better access and the staff who was cleaning up grumbled dissatisfied. I found the attitude inappropriate.\n",
            "My wife asked the cashier for a portion of grilled salmon, since they don't usually leave that option on the buffet. The employee asked my wife to ask another employee who was replacing the food. This employee simply turned his back and walked away. We don't know if he would fulfill the request or not. We waited a few minutes and gave up on the salmon.\n",
            "We make this same request in all the Vienna stores we go to and we never had any problems. Anyway, the service at this store is really disappointing.\n",
            "Climate of boteco and Bahian food, there's no mistaking it. The atmosphere is simple but very charming and the food is typically northeastern. On the menu there are options such as broth of sururu, acarajé, vatapá, caruru, among others. We ordered a baked fish that accompanied flour, rice and vinaigrette. The fish served 03 people and cost approximately 60.00 reais. We will definitely return again to taste the acarajé.\n",
            "When talking about burgers, we tend to imagine bread with hamburgers, cheese and salad. This is for those who don't know Madero! The burger served is wonderful and the meat is ..... it is .... divine in seasoning, point and texture!\n",
            "The best I've ever eaten. Chef Durski is to be congratulated!\n",
            "In addition to having the best cheeseburger, it also has a very varied menu and a very cozy atmosphere. No wonder it is recommended by the best magazines! First I went to one in Curitiba and then in Foz do Iguaçu. For those who do not know the network, enter the site and search for the nearest address. Very recommended !!!!!!\n",
            "The restaurant is very well located, the value is affordable and you choose the side dishes separately. I also recommend ordering tilapia with provolone, simply delicious. It has space for children to play (small, but there is). It is not suitable for those who intend to prolong the night, as the kitchen closes early.\n",
            "I have already eaten various dishes such as pasta, meat, fish etc. all were excellent. good wines at fair prices as well as the food\n",
            "Great. A special place in Salvador. Wonderful gourmet pizza, very nice location, very varied wine list, very well chosen background music with interesting images. Great service.\n",
            "In a very pleasant environment, with great service, very well prepared dishes, great wine list. It is not cheap.\n",
            "Horrible! We were standing in a corner because there was no table to sit ... a blonde (I don’t know who it is, but it’s from the bar), put a table where we were, told us to leave and didn’t bother explaining why she I was putting a table for Pedro (a nice customer) where we were ...\n",
            "Good to start with a Parmesan cheese and parma ham. Osso buco is wonderful! Best sago with cream in town!\n",
            "Jaber is one of the most famous arabian food. It is a very traditional arabian food, well located on Rua Domingos de Moraes (near Paraíso metro station) I advise you to go there and eat some kibes and esfihas at a counter where you can see all the food and chat with the waiters and other customers.\n",
            "Helpful staff. Well elaborated menu. I recommend a visit. Depending on the time I recommend booking. We love the atmosphere and the food.\n",
            "We are regular customers of the house, always very well attended, we highlight the good food and the service of the collaborator Midiã, congratulations!\n",
            "The place is charming, mixing a snack bar with Acougue, the contrast is interesting\n",

            "Prices are really good even compared to other burgers\n",
            "\n",
            "The taste is delicious, I ordered the double, the blend came soft and juicy! The house mayonnaise is also delicious!\n",
            "\n",
            "Now the service is terrible, it took me 18 minutes to show up and ask what I wanted, the waitress was frowning, she was harsh and inconvenient\n",
            "\n",
            "I will highlight, because the place / flavor / cost benefit are worth the visit\n",
            "Beautiful place, good location, polite people, excellent service, beautiful decoration, delicious food\n",
            "I was surprised by this restaurant that by the region exceeds expectations. Although simple and with the appearance of a normal self-service, it offers a good diet and an excellent cut of soft and tasty meat. The price is the best.\n",
            "In fact it is the restaurant's rung bar.\n",
            "Everything I tasted was very good, but I liked the bohemian shrimp more.\n",
            "Despite not having asked this time, it is worth trying the pastries, sensational and dry pasta. Whenever I go to the restaurant, the pastries are \"mandatory\"\n",
            "The beer is super cold and the service was good.\n",
            "One more advantage is having the support of the restaurant kitchen and you can order dishes from the restaurant too, so it is possible to satisfy everyone.\n",
            "I recommend !\n",
            "For the proposal of the restaurant I found it very organized. Great variety at the buffet all very tasty. The bathroom is impeccable and very well decorated. Super fast service and the price is great.\n",

            "Very well located, frequented, great menu, a privileged view of the sea, the launch of the Invicta coolers is a show, there will never be a lack of beer on the table ...\n",
            "capixaba food? like a muqueca without that disgusting oil palm in the Bahian version? the place is here !!!!\n",
            "feel and feel free ... nothing to notice the simplicity of the place ... it is so homemade and simple, you will eat well and pay very little.\n",

            "Diverse and good quality menu, drink at a fair price. Good service and family atmosphere. Valet.\n",
            "Good options of typical Brazilian dishes with a spartan rereading. Great service and good prices, but the dishes serve 02 people, they are very large.\n",
            "When you have food restrictions, finding a place that suits you, and having delivery, is almost like winning the lottery! I don't live in Brasilia, but I was just passing by and I loved the sandwich. The meat on the spot, juicy, plenty of cheese (lacfree).\n",
            "The location is very simple, as well as the way of serving, everything is served at the table. I think it's great! The meat is very good, the attendants are very polite and friendly, the price is quite fair and serves the best fried polenta I've ever eaten!\n",
            "This restaurant has a higher cost, but it has excellent service and the dishes are delicious and for those who like meat there is no mistake, any dish will be satisfied.\n",
            "In addition to the wonderful service, the cuisine is simply spectacular. We eat À GREEK - Breaded, served over Greek rice and gratin with tomato sauce and mozzarella cheese and straw potatoes ... #superindicoprato\n",
            "The waiters are very attentive but few, overloading their work and condemning the experience. The snack rotation option takes a long time to leave the dishes, it took more than half an hour to spend a mini burger (really more than half an hour, I counted the time) and it is still a very sleepy mini burger. The other dishes are no big deal (chicken fillet, chicken drumstick, breaded onion, fries and etc.) all half-hearted. The rib was good, but it only passed twice in more than 1 hour of rotation. I'm not coming back and I don't recommend the experience.\n",
            "For me it was the best Ancho Steak I've ever eaten - the same level as the Argentine and Uruguayan Steak Steaks - fantastic meat, impeccable service and peaceful atmosphere. Grade 10 !\n",
            "We went to Arbori last Friday, 17/11/17. In addition to being a visually beautiful restaurant, it offers a varied menu and dishes with very large portions, in addition to bringing starters and desserts included in the (super reasonable) price of the dishes! The service is very good and kind. It's worth the visit! I highly recommend it!\n",
            "Perfect service, excellent dishes and starters, good wine and drinks list, the ambience and presentation out of the standard. Highly recommend\n",
            "Great place for a family lunch or with friends. The barbecue carvery is very good and varied. The place is quite exquisite. And the service is excellent.\n",
            "Within the style of the restaurant, I consider it as one of the best. The attendants are very attentive, always with a smile, quick with the orders and the juices are the rest !!!! Fresh fruit, freshly made, and the price well into account. It is always with people, but soon a table is found. I recommend.\n",
            "I went to Spot with a group of friends and when I got there I went through the door, I saw the restaurant crowded (usually a sign that the place / food is good) ... Well, I stood inside the restaurant waiting to be served by the hostess ... someone else, however, no one came in the almost 30 minutes I stayed there. There was no one person to obtain information.\n",
            "Beautiful atmosphere, very attentive service and perfect food. The restaurant brings together all the ingredients necessary for success.\n",
            "Several options on the menu to the point of making order difficult. I had the impression that the best dishes are for 4 people. Dishes well served. Very high price but good quality.\n",
            "AWESOME service I don't recommend. I had to order 3 times, the last time was more than 1 hour and it didn't arrive. There is no one who can take it, right? I'll never step here again.\n",
            "in porto de morena everything is perfect the beaches the restaurants. the place itself is very beautiful. just being there to know. I recommend this place.\n",
            "With so many options for comparisons there is no way to remain silent. It's good. I wouldn't be able to tell you anything more about food. The style of service, pay and pick up, I don't like.\n",
            "Super nice atmosphere, great food, live music and great value for money. Fair price! I recommend.\n",
            "Takes average tastes and the pastel nobody liked. I highlight the super friendly, efficient service. In addition, the following day 4 people in the group had intestinal infection but we cannot say if it was eaten in the restaurant.\n",
            "Everything a beach hut has to have, and then some. Incredible atmosphere, breathtaking scenery on the edge of Maceió, live sound (DJ or band), varied and tasteful snacks and drinks !! Drinks in hand in ice buckets or coolers, charging only what is consumed. The extra thing is due to the space with the option of air conditioning. Pleasant afternoons guaranteed !!\n",
            "I recommend ! Tasty food, impeccable service, extremely pleasant and comfortable environment. The wine with the name of each one is formidable. They may\n",
            "Go without error !! I went to the Faria Lima unit, good parking and on Saturdays it goes straight until night!\n",
            "Very nice place, with great service. The carvery is diverse and delicious. Suggestion for Robata, a very tasty fish skewer. I also really like the breaded squid. Worth knowing.\n",
            "Very pleasant place in the Republic region, next to a well wooded square.\n",
            "The waiter's service was very good, the prices are fair and the clientele is very lively. It has live music.\n",
            "Galeto 183, also known as Galeto da Tia Ana, is a spectacular place. It has the spectacular Filet Mignon, giant and juicy ... The garlic toast is phenomenal ... But none of this would be possible without Aunt Ana ... Who with her friendliness and unparalleled service, welcomes everyone with special care. .. Come on, you will not regret it ...\n",
            "Excellent service, the girl who attended me was very friendly taking my doubts. Nice atmosphere and well decorated, I will be back for sure. I found the coffee (clever option) very tasty, but nothing extraordinary. Very tasty chocolate cookie!\n",
            "Facing the beach, beautiful view is great environment delicious food with tablets for kids' distraction.\n",
            "The bad point of this establishment is that the service is soooo long. The price is good and so is the food, but don't be hungry because you still wait a long time. = (\n",
            "Whoever goes to Espírito Santo and wants to try the delicious moqueca capixaba should take advantage of this restaurant. The decor is beautiful and the staff are very welcoming. We went on a Sunday and had live music, the place is quite lively. In addition it has kids space. The food is delicious and the menu is very diverse. The value is above the average of the city's restaurants, but it's worth it!\n",
            "Great meal and excellent service.\n",
            "We were very well attended by Matheus Carvalho ... very friendly and attentive.\n",
            "I came with my boyfriend on an unpretentious night and I was surprised, even with the great recommendations I had already received. We were welcomed and taken care of by the charismatic Tibu, who served us wonderfully well.\n",
            "The entrance was very tasty, the seafood melted in your mouth. And the drinks menu is a unique experience. It has the power to take us to different parts of the world, precisely because of the cosmopolitan vibe of the bar. This has to do with the setting, it seems to transport us out of the city of Rio de Janeiro.\n",
            "I certainly intend to return again and again!\n",
            "A very cozy and well-characterized atmosphere, the restaurant offers a wide variety of typical northeastern dishes. Delicious cajá juice, without commenting on the desserts. worth knowing\n",

            "Those who like to visit different restaurants and creative menus cannot fail to check out the creativity of the Cyber ​​Lanch sandwiches. Besides the good idea, the taste is also pleasant. The service was very good. It is worth checking.\n",

            "Wonderful food, service and drinks.\n",
            "Very pleasant atmosphere.\n",
            "Music and dessert with candle for a personalized celebration🍾🎂💞👏👏👏\n",
            "I went to celebrate my birthday with my friends and honestly, we felt a little out of place. The place is really beautiful, the drinks excellent ... but for a romantic evening. Practically only couples. As for the view ... beautiful, but if it is for the view, go to the Italy Terrace.\n",
            "Elegance, tranquility and the security of enjoying a quality service, with all the requirements that a hotel should offer.\n",

            "In addition to the delicious food and the super cozy atmosphere, I loved the service. At the beginning you have to ask the trio, with that Saj bread they make on the spot and you can even see the production. Very good!\n",
            "Self service restaurant, with many options of dishes, including barbecue and Japanese cuisine.\n",
            "I'm a big fan of subway sandwiches, addicted to tuna and turkey breast with parmesan bread and mustard sauce with honey. Perfect!\n",
            "I went to the establishment to have lunch, I must have been very unlucky because, the place, using the avenue sidewalk, was very dirty, the waiters were rude and the food, even though it was the dish of the day, was cold. It was a shame!\n",
            "Nice place, differentiated menu. A great option in Porto Alegre for those looking for a luxury restaurant.\n",
            "As the name says the self-service serves some very homemade food from the same rock.\n",
            "Large environment with several well ventilated lounges with playground for children.\n",

            "For me, one of the best pizzerias! Nice service, delivery as expected and pizzas de-li-ci-o-sas !!! Usually I ask to deliver at home, but I know that the pizzeria has a space to eat there, only, as far as I know, the sale on the spot is only slices. A single observation I make is that they often included a small bag with some ketchup and mayonnaise sachets in the order of R $ 1.00 without asking if I wanted to or not. Until I found out they were charging, the last impression was courtesy of the house.\n",
            "Attendance note 1. 000 by Miss Mariana. Dinner was great, the restaurant is well decorated and the food is very good. I will definitely be back to try the other items on the menu. The price is right! congratulations.\n",
            "Fair price, impeccable service and food. Recommended, great option for Sunday lunch.\n",
            "I felt disappointed. I expected more from the place. I ordered a picanha for two and it was not very tasty apart from being tough. The service also left something to be desired.\n",
            "Pleasant and well decorated environment. Impeccable service. We ordered the beiju with crab, suggested by the waiter, and we didn't regret it! As a main course we ordered the shrimp bobó, which was also delicious! It is certainly worth the visit.\n",
            "Good option for typical northeastern food. The atmosphere is good and the restaurant was almost full around 1 pm. A little confusion when paying the bill.\n",
            "Great, at the request of the waiter Alejandro cozy atmosphere. I highly recommend fish dish ....\n",
            "The house maintained the impeccable standard of service and cuisine of the Paraiba matrix. Menu with unique and very tasty options (if you haven't visited João Pessoa or Brasília). A word of caution: remember to leave room for dessert.\n",

            "Restaurant with excellent food and service. I recommend the codfish dumpling and the smoked duck with shitake risotto. High standard restaurant price (we paid 280 a couple, with drinks).\n",
            "Japanese food with a carvery option. The cool thing is that you have the option of asking for a \"suggestion\" from the chef who will set up a combo without the customer's choice. Thus, you can get to know some parts and order later in the desired quantity.\n",
            "Currently it costs R $ 79. For those who are staying in Rio Vermelho and are tired of regional food ... it's a good option!\n",
            "Excellent wine list, with affordable prices and good labels. The best starter is the goat cheese and roasted tomato bruschetta. Spectacular funghi risotto. The courtesy of the waiters is surprising to Salvador\n",

            "This restaurant is one of the best options of dish made in the mall. Generous portions (those who eat little may find it excessive) and still cheap. It also makes it possible to escape a little from the confusion of the food court by offering space to eat on your counter.\n",
            "We were MT Well received and served by waiter Anderson.\n",
            "The parmegiana fillet was MT Good and at a Great Price!\n",

            "I was on Saturday night, during the September 7 holiday (less crowded than usual due to the evasion of São Paulo residents), with my husband and son. We ordered fried kibe that came cold and the beer that came frozen! Although empty, the service was slow and inattentive. Employees concerned with delivery and not with customers at the tables. The beer was changed and again came frozen, glasses for 2 when we asked for us3. Couple at the next table also complaining. Expensive prices for the food level. The waitress Bia apologized when she brought the bill, but nothing was offered as compensation / courtesy for the staff's mistakes. Counter staff apparently laughing at our complaints. Not worth it.\n",
            "I bought the take-out snack at the little window outside.\n",
            "The pork snack is really good, worth a try. The value is also fair, 17 reais.\n",

            "Large, airy, picturesque place, cold beer always with a wide menu of German cuisine. Located within Largo da Ordem, a historic place with several bars\n",
            "Very different from a traditional restaurant. You eat with a smell coming directly from the garden next door. The products are very natural. I loved the experience of having so many fruits on the main course, but I like fruits on the main course. Maybe those who don't like sweet flavors so much with the dish won't appreciate it that much. But it is worth the experience.\n",
            "The juice with frozen is very tasty and great to refresh on a hot day\n",

            "The restaurant has good service and good food, with a wide variety of typical foods. The environment also harks back to local culture. It is not expensive, although it is also not cheap.\n",
            "Impeccable and attentive service. I have the impression that the fact of being small helps in the whim of both the service and the kitchen. They understand the customer well and do everything to make the experience exceptional. I live in São Paulo, I know countless good restaurants and I find this exceptional.\n",
            "The bar was having a company party which made it impossible to hear, hear the music or the people around you. Worse that on a Saturday. Lack of total notion of the bar owner, for one day he will lose at least 100 customers\n",
            "The service is great, with a pleasant and peaceful environment, inviting you to return for many more times. The food is of a very good quality. The restaurant is very well located, with easy parking.\n",

            "A place with several environments, all in very good taste\n",
            "I like the atmosphere in this bar. The price is right and the snacks and dishes are usually good. I've been to the bar a few times, but on one occasion the service was poor: it took a long time and the dish didn't have the usual quality. I went back there and the service was normal.\n",
            "It's really like a tavern, but with cod and delicious (and cheap) food. The codfish cake, after all, is a small Portuguese restaurant, it's delicious! Dishes, for lunch, good and cheap, and at night, there is the so-called caldo verde as well. Worth it!\n",
            "The perfect combination is Tuesday's combo, of a long neck skol beer bucket with a portion of breaded tilapia stuffed with provolone, the flavor is perfect, wonderful seasoning and the beer is cracking, not to mention the good and affordable price. I loved the place because it has its own area for children with a ball pool and slides at no cost. I recommend with my eyes closed.\n",

Not to mention the discount coupon promotions, in my case, I paid R $ 124.90 for the carvery + 1 liter of beer for 4 people.\n",
            "We really liked the part of the mezzanine that has the Karaoke, before I could book closed, but now it needs 80 people to close the space. Last week I celebrated my birthday there for 20 people and there is no problem in sharing the space. I just think that there should be an employee responsible only for the equipment and that a control be performed per table, as some groups dominate the music.\n",
            "In addition, everything is very well served. On other occasions we had problems with the service, which left something to be desired, but this time it was quiet.\n",

            "Dishes serving up to 3 people, prompt service and the dishes came super fast. Average price for a couple dinner, with two soft drinks, without alcohol, about R $ 140.00. Worth the cost benefit. When we return to João Pessoa we will go to this restaurant for sure.\n",
            "Excellent option in Pelourinho. It is half hidden at the top of a slope, but it is worth the climb. Nice atmosphere, well decorated, very fast service and abundant and delicious food, we ate the feijoada and it was very tasty and well made. Very affordable price. I recommend.\n",

            "I went through a collective shopping coupon that entitled to a Mexican lasagna and dessert. The lasagna is delicious, the portion is very well served, it is very tasty and the presentation is very beautiful. I didn't consider it excellent because I didn't like dessert, a type of churro, I found it very nauseating and because the service also left something to be desired. It was full at lunch time, due to the promotion and there were only 2 waitresses, very moody by the way, it took almost half an hour between the end of the lasagna and the arrival of dessert, I even had to get up to know what was going on, because they they gave no satisfaction.

Now talking about the food that is SPECTACULAR, in a few restaurants there is such a sophisticated, elegant, tasty cuisine. Perfect service, perfect wine list, and with fair prices, for all budgets. Required !!!\n",
            "After a long delay they brought me a different dish than what was on the menu. Small thing: They just forgot about the moqueca fish ... Complaint made, 15 minutes later came the complement in the form of tiny pieces from the back of the fish, close to the tail. I paid twice the price I would pay at a good restaurant 100 meters away.

            "I confess that I expected more from the establishment. We went on Sunday afternoon, and even then, we waited 50 minutes in line. When we entered, the atmosphere disappointed me a little. From the Star Wars universe, only the panels on the walls and lighting resembling the lightsaber. The characters did not appear. But the food is good and the service is fast. Thanks for the visit. And only.\n",
            "The place is beautiful, with varied dishes, excellent starters and very well attended. If possible, ask for a table on the balcony, as the view is a must. However the service is not up to what the house offers, leaving the experience of visiting this place incomplete.\n",

            "First day of the year, a lunch at La Fiorentina is a good choice, especially on a family Sunday. Excellent Italian food. There is flexibility in the menu.

            "As there are three units and I went to the three, there is a difference between them, the one of the tower as it was the first dropped the pattern mainly in the area below. I particularly think that when you have a restaurant with the same name, you must maintain the standard of quality in services in the same way. unfortunately it doesn't. They are different dishes and the one in the tower is the same as any steakhouse in the neighborhood. If not worse. The meats are falling short. but we have Maria Sales in Tambaú.com in a pleasant environment. More needs to be improved in meat, not least because it is the flagship of the steakhouse. as in service in general. and gold is very good and very expensive. especially at night when meat is eaten very little. More generally a good restaurant\n",

In addition, the last of the four temakis took about 1 hour to arrive and they also brought 1 temaki that we hadn't asked for. When we asked for another temaki it also took about an hour to arrive and in the meantime they brought two other temakis to the table that we hadn't asked for, demonstrating the disorganization of the restaurant. In the account, another problem. They charged for all the temakis, including the ones we hadn't asked for. The service provided by the waiters was unfortunate. I do not recommend.\n",

There are some parking lots nearby, but I went on Saturday and it was quieter. Place is very cool / beautiful, sometimes has craft beer (I was unlucky). The hamburger is good with a beautiful blend. As already said, the service is very good. The food turned very fast. My wife ordered the potato veggie, and it's great, but the consistency is not hamburger, but the taste is sensational. I talked to one of the owners and he is looking for a solution without disturbing the taste. I ate the caramel and it is very interesting, but friends ordered the BBQ and this will be my next order. I liked it and recommend it. Ah the chicken starter is very good, with emphasis on mayonnaise.\n",

            "Access is a bit difficult, but it is very worthwhile for those who like what is good, that is, simple and natural. Surrounded by trees, including jabuticaba trees! That alone is worth a trip. Good service and quality food, excelling in the cultivation of their own garden and orchard products, which makes it a restaurant with exclusive flavors. Nowhere else will you find yourself the same.\n",
            "Really one of the best burgers I have ever eaten. The environment and service are excellent. Even the people in training serve very well. The rib with barbecue sauce is a marvel. Congratulations to the chef / owner.\n",
            "I liked everything. Even if you are allergic to seafood. There was a salad called Dunkan, with fruits and nuts, and a dish called \"Sertanejo\". My friends' dishes had the scent of good food. Which is what the restaurant exudes.\n",
            "Simple facilities, in a populous neighborhood of Salvador. Far away from the beach.\n",

            "I had dinner there with my wife about celebrating her birthday. The atmosphere and service were very good, with a nice surprise dessert for her. However, the wine suggested was not so harmonious with the plates that we ordered: I could have done better, choosing myself. Good food, but there are many equally good restaurants in São Paulo for almost half the price.\n",

            "Surprised me. I go to Eataly just to buy items for a special dinner at home or for pizza down there. I never wanted to have dinner there, it is very crowded, I don't like the proposal. But we were in a group and relaxed. We bought 2 ice-cold wines right there and our spinach ricotta lasagna was perfect. For informal occasions worth, fair price, credits for the chef!\n",

            "The food is really regional ... very diverse. . .but everything regional! You also have the option of grilling (chicken, meat or fish). In addition, you can walk around the teapot ... yes the restaurant works inside a teapot ... by the way ... lindoooooo! I just found the food expensive ... even if it's the kilo! Very expensive!\n",
            "Good restaurant. Large and comfortable place. Food with varied seafood is well served. Attentive waiters. Reasonable price.\n",
            "Wonderful beach! Beautiful landscape! Hot waters! Great structure for children with calm waters and swimming pool. We stayed in the lounge where we paid in addition to R $ 30.00 per person, the amount of R $ 100.00 for the space. For those who like to \"flaunt\" it is perfect! The only difference is in the structure with exclusive kiosks and wooden deck. Electronic music all about the environment. Menu with very good food. Sommelier Juliana super nice and friendly. Do not forget to know that it is worth it!\n",
            "We went to the Pici restaurant for a mid-week lunch, enjoying our vacation. The option of the menu of the day was very good, great dish of Rigatoni with funghi with starter and dessert. The requested carbonara was lacking a little flavor, the pasta cooked in the right spot, well presented but without much flavor.\n",
            "My dish was beautiful, it was an octopus with baroa puree and onion, which also lacked flavor.\n",
            "The highlight is the very good service and pleasant atmosphere.\n",

            "\n",
            "Once there, we ordered the week restaurant menu: Benedictine eggs, rib egg and milk pudding.\n",
            "Benedictine eggs were totally bland, the yolk was not entirely soft and the hollandaise sauce did not exist.\n",
            "The main dish, pork ribs with brie “risotto” with yolk is terrible! To start, the ribs were a strange yellowish and greasy color, the risotto was not risotto, it was an old and tasteless rice. Brie didn't exist!\n",
            "The bolovo, which was supposed to be the specialty of the house, was hard-hitting.\n",
            "I couldn't eat almost anything on my plate (see photo)\n",
            "Finally, dessert came, milk pudding. The pudding itself was ok, but it was accompanied by a strawberry syrup with an artificial taste that ended the taste of the pudding, terrible!\n",
            "\n",
            "The service was very bad, all messy, to start it took a long time to bring the menu, then each dish took a long time. The waiter's justification was that the other waiter was new and had taken our plate to another table.\n",
            "\n",
            "I expected that the house, being specialized in egg, would have exceptional dishes, but it was disappointing. We will not be returning and do not recommend!\n",
            "Great place to go with family and friends, calm, quiet, I recommend it to everyone who likes to be in a quiet place.\n",
            "Steakhouse with very simple salad buffet. Normal barbecue, without much variety. Beers with restricted variety.\n",

            "Alias ​​who has a child can bring that the environment meets\n",
            "Very simple and popular environment, it is located in Cidade Baixa, on a busy avenue that is not a tourist spot in Salvador. However, the fillet acebolado, made with red wine sauce and other ingredients in secret, is just fantastic in taste, color and perfect texture. The service is simple, but friendly and the prices are very good.\n",

            "A nice place, you can buy slices of pizza, it has an incredible showcase, a place that is beautiful and cozy, I had a chicken quiche, I thought it was a bit past, it should have been in the showcase for a long time, just be aware of it, product exposure time, I ate the pizza and it was very good.\n",
            "Service note 10 from start to finish. I asked to sit inside because it was cold in RJ last night. Promptly served, I ordered a half caprese / half shimeji pizza.

            "Before entering ask if you have a table, as they charge entry and after you enter there is no table. This can only be in Belém, it's a joke .... learn\n",

            "The best pastries from Goiânia, there are several flavors, more like tourino that I am, I always go for chicken with guariroba and a very cold soda. The cleaning is grade 10, the attendants super efficient.\n",
            "The pizzas are very good and the price is not exorbitant. However the service left something to be desired when I went there.\n",
            "I am a frequent visitor and I am just compliments. Cod is the flagship (excellent) but the other dishes leave nothing to be desired. Delicious parmigiana ... It is not a chic environment but it is comfortable, that matters.\n",

We ordered a fish dish (sea bass) that contained a description of fresh asparagus, but, SERIOUSLY, it came less than HALF ASPARGO, chopped and mixed with a risotto OK note, the salty sauce and IDENTICAL TO MY HUSBAND'S FILE PLATE. The fish is small and I am a person who eats very little.\n",
            "My husband's file dish came with salty sauce. The file size was fine, but nothing special either. The manioc cake was very weak, expensive in a cheap restaurant.\n",
            "The restaurant's caipirioska has a good price, but made with pulp, that is, juice with vodka. In the country of caipiroska and in a good restaurant, not leaving the fruit visible and mashed is a BIG mistake.\n",

            "The restaurant was empty, so there was no rush in the kitchen.\n",

            "Great to meet friends, quiet place, pleasant climate. I found the high prices, good food, good service.\n",
            "I have been to other times and tried other dishes. This time we ordered the spicy fish, bifun the house style and the nira. It took time to arrive, perhaps because they are not used to serving these dishes. The nira and the bifun were great, the fish comes in small pieces, it was not as we expected. ... and we don't like it very much. We will be back, but we will not repeat the fish.\n",
            "They are now installed at the corner of Rua Anita Garibaldi and Freire Alemao. The sequence at lunchtime is 50 reais, and after 30 minutes of waiting, not even the water had been served. Too long. Lost employees. Good quality food, but poor service. Too bad. I will not return more.\n",

The dishes we savored were delicious, from the typical bread, served hot, with the traditional side dishes, to a perfect mignon in terms of flavor. Has delivery service.\n",
            "We went in the first week of operation. We arrived before the booked time. In fact, the question of booking by application is a ball inside.\n",
            "However, the service is still time consuming and confusing. They were confused about the starters and the drinks. The dishes: Dalton Vigh was very good. The mincemeat, without taste. The Carol Macedo dessert was also no big deal. Unfortunately.\n",
            "Finally, they got the bill wrong, which was adjusted right away ...\n",
            "Summary: it is worth killing the desire to know, but it is not worth the price charged. Can improve...\n",

We received an indication to go to the old Avenida Amelia Rosa because it is a place with a great concentration of bars and restaurants, and it was when we saw the place, that it starts to be different because it is structured in containers, the facade is all colorful, colors well alive and has 2 skulls dressed in Mexican clothes. The service is great, all the waiters are willing to take orders promptly, and they explained everything we asked. It has some craft beer options, including one from Alagoas production, they also have an inviting drink menu, with different and tasty options. The Mexican food menu is a case in point, we had doubts about what to eat, of so many good options. We ordered the traditional starter nachos, which comes with 3 side dishes, all incredible, and chicken Quesadilla, all delicious!\n",
            "It was a very pleasant night, too bad we discovered the place on our last night in Alagoas.\n",

Well located and with good complimentary dessert. Perfect for those who want to have quality lunch in the right measure of their hunger.\n",
            "The recommendations were reliable to the place. The staff, in addition to being very friendly, knows how to sell the house and its dishes well. The dishes are tasty and varied, with many topical elements to the cuisine of Minas Gerais.\n",
            "I'm a regular customer of Forneria's pizzas. It still has a good price, but a lot of flavor and variety. Delivery works well and delivery is always fast.\n",

            "It is difficult to speak of a place where everything is wonderful. A traditional pastry shop that also serves lunch during the week, with impeccable quality. It is not a cheap place, you can easily spend R $ 30.00, but it is worth giving yourself the pleasure of enjoying such a flavor. My preference is the shrimp fingers and the German pie.\n",
            "It is the place in Rio de Janeiro to meet friends, eat the best hamburger in Rio, have a homemade draft beer and hear a quality sound! Congratulations to those involved, Note 10!\n",
            "The pasta I ordered was not good. It was very yellow. I don't know if they added any product to make it that color. In addition, it was all broken into small pieces, which takes away the characteristic of the product. The sauce was good, but it wasn't olive oil (I asked for garlic and oil). The chicken flie was on point and the portion was fully satisfactory.\n",
            "Very good service, punctuality, very charisma from the waiter. Excellent quality service, approved and indicated, congratulations. Claudemir\n",

            "We stopped by chance on our first day in Natal. Then we came back 3 times in the same week. And look, I don't usually repeat a restaurant when I travel. But this one is worth it. Simple atmosphere but with wonderful food that you will not miss for the best rated restaurants in the city. I recommend breaded shrimp with sesame seeds, seafood stew, shrimp from Bahia. And I'm still going back to prove more.\n",
            "Fast service, not too courteous, but agile, the sururu broths, shrimp are excellent, in the beginning order the rennet cheese enough for 4 people.\n",

            "The real and genuine taste of Japanese cuisine is here. I even get nostalgic for my years spent in Japan when I have lunch at this delicious restaurant. The atmosphere is simple and makes you feel like you are in Wakayama. Order the \"teishoku\" or meal of the day. Although it is individual, it serves 2 people. Ask for an additional pot to divide the misoshiro (soup) and the goran (rice). My favorite teishoku is salmon. There are several side dishes, including tsukemonos (Japanese pickles), vegetables and other delicacies.\n",
            "I highly recommend it. Excellent cuisine. Mix regional ingredients with\n",
            "flavors of international cuisine. In addition, the view of Teatro Amazonas completes the ambience.\n",

            "I went to the Ponteio Carnival that I hadn't been in a long time, and I'm impressed that we haven't been able to surprise ourselves with anything, the same thing for at least 15 years, nothing is done to innovate, on the contrary even what I like to eat in a steakhouse. I couldn't eat there, ordered a breaded onion and until now it hasn't arrived, the good meats are the same as always, not to mention that you order a coffee that doesn't come with any pleasure, nor a petit four, a restaurant like this is not acceptable do not please your customer with a cookie, a chocolate whatever, the customer always waits, I myself will not return to a restaurant that doesn’t have a petit four in the cafe.\n",
            "I don't plan to return anytime soon ....\n",

You have the option of the Charque burger, which comes with rennet cheese, house salad, sweet potato straw and a touch of ingenious honey, it is juicy and simply delicious. The Tuscan sausage and pepperoni burger is unlike anything and draws attention with its incredibly tasty garlic paste! It has hamburger options for all tastes and to complete, at lunch, they serve delicious and super affordable dishes. Chicken Parmigiana for R $ 11.00 and sun meat in cream for R $ 17.00. It is worth checking!\n",
            "\"In front of the theater, very beautiful, fresh, but with little variety of food, it's in the kilo, I had lunch there, but as it was the only place I found at lunch I liked it.\"\n",
            "I was recently with the family and loved the place. The beach in front is great! Clear and calm waters. Very good service and excellent food! Generous and tasty portion. And there was something unexpected during my visit: I forgot at the bar a bag with a camera inside. I called at night, after I remembered it and was relieved to know that everything was kept, including a hat that I had left and didn't even remember anymore. This is another favorable point! A single however: you have to arrive early!\n",

            "The food undoubtedly pleased everyone, our group was large and eclectic, including young people and children. The drinks are great, well served and different, we tried a Gin with guaraná jesus (we love it). Desserts are a show apart, the chocolate sphere is divine and the experience is very good. The service left something to be desired, we arrived early, it was still empty and even then the attendant was not solicitous or friendly. It got to be rude at times, we asked for a water and it did not come even after several charges and that upset us in a way, but the experience is good, they need to improve the service, the talz that attended us lacked humility and friendliness.\n",

            "Cameroon dishes are well served and not even prepared! Also I was surprised when the bill arrived, I thought I was going to pay X and I paid X / 2! Try asking for a crab shell or shrimp pastry at the beginning! Delicious!!!!\n",

            "We were not lucky, or the kitchen was not on its best day. I am a client of Roça, another home owned by the owner and I have always eaten well, perhaps because of this anxiety about knowing this new proposal. We stayed at the top of the house, beautiful view and nice proposal.\n",
            "Then the problem begins, we had no service, tables very close to each other, which allowed us to hear the dissatisfaction of the next table, regarding the service regarding the food.\n",

Besides, high prices for what was served.\n",
            "Main we ordered 3 different dishes, one vegetarian which costs almost 70 reais and poorly served, but with good flavor.

            "The food is delicious, fast and very affordable. The only problem is the cover charge, which is imposed on the customer. The waiter does not ask if the customer wants, he brings the cover charge and when you think it is a gift from the house, the value comes into the account.\n",
            "I go to Beach Caldos a lot to drink Caldo da Caridade, which by the way is very good. However, yesterday I decided to take the vegetable soup and had the displeasure of having to pay for something I didn't eat, as it was awful.\n",

            "Good atmosphere, the food doesn't take long, the price remains high due to the amount of food that comes, but it is only worth bringing the family and enjoying one of the best sun meats I've ever eaten.\n",

            "I was surprised by exquisite service and high quality meats at this unit in the chain. I usually go to Natal and I confess that the quality in Potiguar soil needs to improve a lot. In that one from João Pessoa I had a wonderful experience with the prime rib cut. It was so soft in the mouth. Salt at the correct point and perfection at the barbecue point. The Christmas team could go there to learn how to properly salt the meat. Amazing. I will always return and I sincerely prefer to take the BR for 180 km to eat well than going out feeling sick from Christmas because of the excess salt brought to the table.\n",
            "This is one of those restaurants where the staff strives to make you feel special. The service is exceptional and the food is perfect.

            "I took a partner to lunch, we were welcomed and put on the table quickly, but we were almost 20 minutes without assistance. We tried in every way to request assistance, but we received some \"we will attend soon\". A restaurant even in demand must be prepared to attend and take orders. I do not recommend.\n",
            "I went to a few years a lot, I came back recently and it is still excellent, the meat is very good, the buffet is good, pasta and the service is still very good.

            "The service is first rate, the side dishes offered (cheese bread, empanadas, egg flour, etc.) despite the little variety, are very tasty, and the dishes offered at the salad and cold buffet are also very delicious. As for the stars of the house, the meats, my family and I were very disappointed. The house offers several noble cuts in the carvery, such as strip roast, premium rib, chorizo ​​steak, ancho steak and tomahawk. However, we find most meats very hard, including special cuts. My mother was unable to chew most of them; he could hardly eat the meat. It is also worth noting that many meats served did not have that characteristic ember flavor, which also generated great frustration ...\n",

            "We went to lunch there. Fair price and good food. Good service. That is, I recommend the place. We ate the sole for 2 people, but served 3 people satisfactorily.\n",
            "My expectations for this dish were quite high. So maybe I was disappointed.\n",
            "The dish comes with a lot of cheese. For this reason, it forms an alloy that has the consistency of gum. The point is that when the dish cools, it looks like rubber. The prawns weren't that big, either.\n",

            "Easy location, restaurant near the Miguel Sutil roundabout with Isaac Póvoas.\n",
            "The pub is a find in the city. Live music, drinks and food, all excellent. The only problem is the price. A small glass of beer (half pint) costs between 12 and 17 reais (May 2017) and the portions, although tasty, become expensive due to the portion size. Still, I will follow the customer.\n",

            "An important tip is that there is free valet service, since parking is tricky.\n",
            "Saanga Grill is a nice place for beef. It is different from most Brazilian barbecue grills, this is not a \"carvery\" - here you order only a single, specific cut of beef, whose portions are generous as are the parts that must be ordered separately. To start, I suggest nothing less Zelia portion of papillae, creamy and grilled over pupunha fire (heart of palm trees) served with seasoned butter. A portion of homemade pork sausages is also a good start. A good, generous and price-oriented option for the week of days, Mon on Fri, is the \"executive lunch\" - starter and main course for a fixed price. Nice beer and wine list at reasonable prices. For good and honest Uruguayan beers, either Patricia and Norteña, as they deserve a sip.\n",

            "The service is not very good ... the menu took a long time to be delivered. After the order was placed we waited a long time to eat. However it is a good restaurant to eat in, but don't expect to save money there. It has a good atmosphere to talk and have fun.\n",

            "The restaurant is beautiful, with a privileged view. I recommend sitting outside (as long as it is not raining, because when we went down a storm it suddenly got wet and we all got wet to go back to the inside of the restaurant. Good food, a little bit over-billed in my opinion, but it’s not news that you pay for the atmosphere ... Great place for a romantic dinner!\n",

We asked the waiter for some suggestions and chose a golden fillet with shrimp and mushroom sauce, with vegetables and broccoli rice. The food was bland, with little seasoning, and the pickled mushrooms were bitter on the plate. Anyway, the place is very beautiful, but the cuisine is too simple for the price that is charged.

The hamburger was super well stuffed and in line with what was requested, but I didn’t feel anything other than the simple well done. Making a correlation with Dom black, which for me is the best in the hamburger business, I think I would have to invest a little more in meat in terms of flavor to be a reference. Everything else was fine ok.\n",

            "Ceará 1, close to Faculdade São Lucas, as far as I know, has maintained quality. The same does not happen with Ceará 2, which, unfortunately, I do not know if it is the supplier of the fish, at one time or another, comes without the quality that made the house famous. The place is open, surrounded by trees, in general with no parking problem and the service is good. But, the last time I was there the fish came quickly, but it was not tasty. The balance came because of the cold beer and the very good pepper. Today, I have difficulties in recommending.\n",

            "The place is well known in Suburbia. For starters you can order the fried needles or the fried carapicu fish, both very delicious. My favorite dish there is seafood, but the shrimp stew is also very tasty. Does not accept card, so only cash, but the owner allows bank transfer. Ah! In the summer it is also hot, but the view is very beautiful.\n",

The dish of the day was a fillet medallion with champignon accompanied by wild potatoes and passion fruit mousse for dessert. The service was exceptional and the food is of an extremely high quality. The codfish cake and the bread roll with olives and eggplant paste are simply fabulous. We had to repeat the entries. lol ... The price is right!\n",
            "The restaurant is small and without much refinement, at the entrance to a hotel. The food is delicious, with a good variety of dishes. Japanese food is a little cheaper than others in the same neighborhood.\n",

            "\n",
            "We ordered shrimp fondue, the appearance is not very beautiful but the taste is wonderful, perfect order. It came with rice with broccoli and rustic potatoes from the house. The dish serves 3 people very well, as 2 are still left. The price is affordable for a restaurant of his level, all very good. The only suggestion would be at least in this dish that we ordered a slightly more attractive presentation and also if there were breaded pink shrimp sold as snacks as it comes in some dishes.\n",

We ordered 2 hamburgers, a french fry and a soda, besides taking too long, the hamburgers came cold and DIDN'T SEE the potato and the soda. The courier did not care to resolve it, he disdained the situation and we were left with the loss. The order was placed through the Uber Eats account in the name of Icaro, my boyfriend, with order number 80ccbc. We ask for refund to the app and my tip is: do not use this establishment! Bad food and worse service.\n",

            "It's done, today it was disappointing, I went with my wife and son and daughter-in-law, we ordered 3 options from a Night Menu with entree, main course and dessert, the meat (very good) and the service from Pires was what saved it, the rest was pitiful. A meal that cost almost R $ 400 deserved it without further elaboration, I complained to Pires and he just said that he would communicate in a meeting, I won't be back.\n",
            "Great service and as always incredible taste. Nothing like celebrating your birthday in style. Extraordinary menu.\n",
            "Great variety of beers. Average prices for specialty beers. More or less service. Highlight for the classic burger of the house, very good indeed, worth a try.\n",

            "Although the hamburger is tasty, the delay in ordering is very long. Full house or not, 1 hour to serve a hamburger is not reasonable. I recommend that they improve since competition in the industry is evident in Goiânia.\n",

            "We arrived and the waiter took a long time, we asked for our order and Willian Amável came and asked what we wanted and promptly answered, he brought our order and accompanied us to dinner. It was super efficient. The other waiter who answered us first and our order did not arrive did not know where it ended up, I just know that the lovely Willa atenseu excelled in his name.

            "We were there about 3 weeks ago. We ordered the famous carne de sol. It is super well served. I would say that for a couple who does not eat much, you can ask for a portion of a person. We ordered the portion for two and it was left over. It is worth checking out the restaurant.\n",

            "very traditional place in the city, where it is worth a visit to get to know the typical German cuisine and drink a good beer. The place is also inviting for a walk, before or after going to Bar do Alemão, such as the Largo da Ordem art fair, which is very close to the Bar.\n",

            "At dawn! What a good shrimp! I am in love with shrimp and as I live sooo far from the sea, I always take the opportunity to splurge when I visit the coast and the shrimp in this restaurant is certainly without comparison. I ended up trying the famous and typical Chiclete de Camarão dish, which boils down to a stupendous shrimp with soooo much melted cheese. A friend, who had already tried the gum, ended up asking for pasta with shrimp to eat on her knees.\n",
            "The atmosphere is very refined and cozy, live music and the service is impeccable (rare thing in Maceió).\n",
            "Going to Maceió and not knowing this restaurant is worthy of pity\n",

            "But since no one goes to a steakhouse to eat cheese bread, there goes my assessment ... the proposal is a tasting menu, with salad ordered separately, without those famous steakhouse buffets, and then the meat served in the same way as in rotisserie type barbecue.\n",
            "The salad is no big deal, simple, and the conclusion I get is that the buffet cost has been saved. Ancho steak at will, but no mouth watering, bland picanha, ribs without seasoning, meat without salt ...\n",

I think it would be better to say that the restaurant was unable to receive more people, so I would have free time to look for another restaurant. Finally when I got a table, but wrap it up for food to arrive and then I realized the reason for the waiting line, 1h 30 min for the dish to arrive after my order and look that it was not absurd, I believe that the chefs of the restaurants were bogged down by orders, but anyway, lack of total restaurant planning, if x quantity of tables are available, they must be able to serve this quantity x. As a consequence of all this, the food was good, nothing excellent, in general, the experience was not good and I missed an entire Sunday afternoon. Another detail, I ordered a strawberry juice of 20.00 R $ that came with much more foam than juice. Anyway, bad experience.\n",

            "We returned to Mitsuba to celebrate another anniversary. The service and food are still good, as are the always cold beers.\n",
            "We went to dinner last week. Very pleasant and welcoming atmosphere. Good service. The wine list is reasonable and honest. However, I took my wines and no cork was charged, which I think is a great merit for a restaurant. The starters (carpaccio, spicy shrimp) were great. Good pastas and meats. Dishes well served. Worth it.\n",
            "We were very well attended by Priscila, who served us a delicious dish called Maria Bonita, as well as very cold draft beer.\n",
            "Top structure, good music, wonderful food, very polite waiters! Bathroom clean! worth knowing\n",
            "I went to dinner yesterday, Tuesday. I found the table easy, the waiters who served me were prompt and agile. Varied menu, the cucumber salad was not \"the most delicious\", but the ginger, hot, tempura, salmon tempan were delicious. Many young and beautiful people, they looked like models.\n",
            "Several varieties of meat, with a wonderful rotation, exceptional service and a wonderful view of Boa Viagem beach.\n",
            "Yummy and comfortable environment for a family meal. The dishes are well served and the prices are fair. Food always fresh and well made. A great place to meet\n",

            "Dishes well served and tasty, in a pleasant place, well decorated. It is a traditional place in Natal. The restaurant specializes in seafood.\n",
            "The restaurant is a self service à kilo type, with a wide variety of delicious food dishes. The service is cordial and the atmosphere pleasant, I recommend.\n",
            "And one of the best restaurants in our city, the food is excellent, service and perfect atmosphere.\n",
            "Excellent hamburger, excellent potato, and very pleasant atmosphere! I celebrated my birthday with the family and got a delicious dessert as a gift (photo). I recommend it to everyone!\n",

            "Special thanks to waiters Abraão, Sabino and Viana.\n",
            "Great! We love the place! Always the same quality. Highlight for raw kibbeh (the very best). Thin and crunchy sfihas. Portions well served. It is worth going as a group to be able to vary the choices and taste different dishes. Fair price. Congratulations.\n",
            "Excellent option after midnight because there is almost no queue, great sandwiches and milk shakes. Very good service. Nice place. But the price increases every day ....\n",
            "Good pizza, for those who like thin crust. Attentive waiters but getting in the way a bit. There is always the promotion of Peixe Urbano but be careful, in addition to getting crowded, the prices of drinks are unreal ... a can of soda at 9.50 for example. I believe that to compensate for the discount on the promotion price, it is widely used. Attention: Arrive early, the line is impossible for those who do not like to wait standing up.\n",
            "Cool bar with tables on the street. Typical mineiro bar. Rua Lourdes is full of these bars and Tizé is probably the best, food and drink at fair prices with good service.\n",
            "The food is good, a little heavy, but it reflects how the Sertanejo eats, corn foods, sun meat, spicy buffalo leftovers, fava beans, etc., the place is well decorated with details of the Northeastern multiculture, clay walls, bent dolls in the window, the bathrooms have details in the old farm houses in Sertão, as well as every restaurant. On Sunday there is a trio of forró pé de serra that plays for breakfast.\n",
            "Good food, well prepared, but it is impossible to go there for dinner and spend less than 100 reais, which is very controlling. Usually the average price is around 200 reais per person. I think the cost-benefit is bad, so much so that I only went twice, because although the food is good it doesn't surprise the amounts charged. The wine list is quite varied but abuses the price, basic wines are offered for 150 reais. The house cover is very simple and does not pay. I suggest going straight to the main course and dessert. For a special occasion, it is worth knowing.\n",
            "The restaurant is located in a more modern region of Salvador, a sophisticated restaurant and excellent food. Coco Bambu is a chain of restaurants, which has several cities in the northeast, which follows its quality standard with a divine cellar in the middle of the room.\n",
            "We went without reservation and didn't wait long to get in! Small but nice place! The most famous dish in the house is delicious! We love the service! Super recommend!\n",

            "Nice atmosphere, very good food and very well served dishes. Highlight also for the service. If you are in the region of Salvador, do not miss the opportunity to visit.\n",
            "Close to the Blue Tree Hotel Congonhas it is great to have a beer with good snacks after work. Rock music and offering freshly baked skewers can't go wrong ...\n",
            "Super excellent restaurant. Tasty dishes, large and well decorated place, and first class service. Parmegianno Jatiuca dishes are more affordable than other restaurants in the same chain.\n",
            "We expected to eat a dry meat in the style we ate in São Luiz, and we were sad !! Hard meat, half an hour chewing! tasteless food, the only spice seemed to be the coriander! We left disappointed! We'd eat better at home!\n",
            "The caster has the same quality. They are well selected and very well prepared meats. The service is good, but twice forgot about my requests (like water and dessert), perhaps due to the large amount of customers of that moment, it compromised the service a little ...\n",
            "We went to the restaurant after looking at some options here on tripadvisor itself.\n",
            "We really like the quality of the food, but the orders took a long time to arrive.\n",
            "We ate as a starter the shrimp gum, signature dish of the house, and we think that although very tasty it should not be ordered as a main dish since the flavor is very intense.\n",
            "In addition, we share an individual dish because when looking at the dishes on other tables, we consider a dish for two very large.\n",
            "We also tried the cheesecake verrine with red berries for dessert. Very good! Worth it!\n",
            "In general, the restaurant is very good and the experience is pleasant.\n",
            "I was recently at the Bar, famous for the intersection of Avenidas São João and Ipiranga, but I didn't like the bar due to some facts. The draft beer for the quantity that is served does not arrive so cold on the table, I ordered a portion of pastry that came full of fat and the smokehouse is in a covered place in what is prohibited in the state of SP.\n",
            "The place is small and almost goes unnoticed on the street, but the pizzas are fantastic, the beer is always cold, sells a 600ml bottle of Heineken, Amstel, Original, etc. To the sound of rock'n roll! Despite making deliveries, the house is unable to meet the demand, so don't be surprised if you call there \"I can't deliver\". The best choice: California Pizza!\n",
            "At Bizzum, I ate the best fillet and pepperoni pizza of my life. The pizza dough is great, thin, crunchy, juicy dough, simply ma-ra-vi-son-sa. The service is very good and the place is clean, pleasant and super cozy. The pizzeria is an environment for the whole family, especially if it is for dating, since the environment is in the dark. I highly recommend it. Too bad the space is small to meet the public's demand. It would be great if there was an expansion of pizzeria services to other neighborhoods. THE\n",
            "Reasonable cost x benefit. Wifi does not work well. Expensive wine list. Terrible attendance. Nice food. One of the waiters picked up napkins that fell on the floor and put them back on a table.\n",
            "It is certain that a trendy restaurant on Valentine's Day can be stolen, but proposing to attend knowing it is at least frivolous with customers. Absurd waiting time for a rattatoile that any rat makes, a pasta that any single person who does not know how to cook can do better and a dessert that is just to be taken out of the Kibon ice cream jar is not even half a star for the restaurant.\n",
            "Maybe if you had the promised view on the website or some thematic environment that reminds you of the famous Spanish painter, you could even earn a star. But not. Mico.\n",
            "It is suggested to work only with reservation these days instead of working as a crowded collective bus. Were it not for the company of my beautiful wife, the restaurant would have made a bad impression. Even so, we will not be returning.\n",
            "I love this restaurant !!! From the environment, the service to the food, which is fantastic. My favorite dish is mignon with tagliatele in white sauce. During the week serves executive lunch at a fixed price that includes main course + dessert. I tried a grilled fish with shrimp and leek risotto amazing!\n",
            "Very cozy place and sensational service. We arrived and sat at the bar to wait for our table. We ordered beer and a starter and the waiter explained to us about the pasta and sauces, presented the menu and was very cordial. Only then has the house gained more points with us. About the food. The corniccione is delicious. It makes you want to eat the sauce. We ordered two unified pizzas - amatriciana and portuga - both divine. For dessert we ordered a Nutella canolli with the best pasta I have ever eaten and delicious ciocollato pie! Anyway, we love everything! From the look of the house, through the service and arriving at the food. Super recommend!\n",
            "JOÃO TIAGO's professionalism and friendliness motivated us to return to the place\n",
            "In the week we were on vacation we had dinner three times. Very good\n",
            "Various options and fair price. Tasty and fast. What kills is going out with your clothes and hair smelling like fried food.\n",
            "Good food, tasty atmosphere and very close to the Book Fair, with fair prices. Options for those who don't like red meat. and excellent natural juices.\n",
            "I had a delicious cappuccino at Croma Café. The atmosphere is very modern, beautiful and pleasant. The price is adequate for being in a mall, and the service was good.\n",
            "Excellent meats, a fried banana and perfect lamb fingers. Excellent cellar. Cozy atmosphere. Good service .\n",
            "Nice atmosphere, location close to the beach, panoramic windows, I didn't take the queue because I went very early, the establishment is large and well lit, the food was divine (prawns and vatapá risotto), at the beginning I tasted a delicious shrimp pastry and even tasted it my son's hidden meat dish.\n",
            "As a suggestion, a space for children could be built.\n",
            "Worth knowing !!!\n",
            "Bar with plenty of well-seasoned snacks and affordable price. Good location, service cuts,\n",
            "The restaurant is very good, but the price is steep. Attentive and quick service, and the food is very tasty.\n",
            "Very good! The esfihas are great and the service was fast.\n",
            "Note: we went on a Monday. Now the environment is not favorable for couples since they have few tables for couples.\n",
            "Traditional, famous in the region and beyond, Rogildo is a bar that hasn't changed over time. Simple atmosphere, average service however, very good food. Fish mush in the coconut is perfect. several seafood options such as fish, shrimp dishes, broths, snacks in general and drinks and drinks. Everything really tasty, you will not regret it if you decide to try it. Option for those who do not want to eat on the spot, order by phone and get ready to eat at home. Another tip: if you're not a drinker like me, go early. Because close to 12h even on weekdays, it sells easily. Ah, now they accept card because before it was just cash. Super tip and I will definitely be back more often.\n",
            "I went there on a Thursday, soon it was empty and quiet, there is a vallet at the door (I think R $ 20 or R $ 25, I don't remember), but in the nearby streets it is possible to park too.\n",
            "\n",

            "Excellent service from Fernando and Thiago. I recommend dinner to everyone. We will be back for sure.\n",
            "I really like the snack. The place is very simple, when it rains it's kind of problematic but worth a try.\n",

            "Sunday lunch very busy. Wait nice because the house offered a taste. The highlight is the selected Angus meats. The prime rib was excellent and accompanied with the correct green salad. Not very affordable prices. Worth it!\n",
            "A pleasant atmosphere and wonderful cuisine, cordial service and a huge variety of sushi. Everything done daily and full of flavor. It is worth scheduling a dinner or lunch. Super recommended!\n",
            "A complete and crowded steakhouse, with several environments, external, internal air-conditioned and non-air-conditioned. The meat of sun and of first quality.\n",
            "Mamma Jamma pizza is one of the most popular and it is not for less. One of the most delicious. A good surprise was the pepper jam pizza. The flavors range from the most exotic to the traditional. It hardly pleases.\n",
            "Only problem is the difficulty to find vacancies for those who do not want to leave the car in the vallet.\n",
            "The wind curve is a very cozy bar, intimate decor, and very good music selection! On the menu there are some very tasty stuffed potatoes, pizzas and for the healthier ones, salads on a whim! It has musical performances, but the negative point is that the acoustics are not good, only if you stay close to the stage that you can enjoy better.\n",
            "Excellent meat, side dishes too. Best churros I've ever eaten. I recommend it for those who appreciate good meat. Cozy atmosphere.\n",
            "This restaurant is located in a privileged area of ​​the city. The accommodations are simple, but compensated by Se's excellent service. Ramiro who is ready to satisfy customers. The food is very abundant, cheap and quality. Suggestion: goat meat !!\n",

            "Has received\n",
            "The tent is cool ... well structured with bathrooms. You can watch the sea while drinking beer. There is only one detail, the food. Despite having a clean kitchen and good service, they fry everything in the same oil, so I couldn't tell the difference in the taste of fish, shrimp and fries !!!! If you're just going to have beer ... it's worth it.\n",
            "Very nice restaurant, I went on a Tuesday when there was not much movement.\n",

            "I ordered a carne de sol and as a side dish came Baião de 2, white rice, string beans, farofa, bananas and cooked cassava (all these side dishes are part of the dish and I didn't ask to add anything). I found the amount of accompaniment a little exaggerated, but I understand that it is the local way of serving.\n",

            "I recommend the meat pastry with pepper jelly at the beginning.\n",

My order was Escondidinho de Camarão for the starter, the Shrimp 5 seas and on the table the Sem Fim, which were delicious. But I recommend the Shrimp Fortuna do Mar, without a doubt the most delicious !!!\n",
            "Restaurant with very good atmosphere and great dishes. Wine list leaves something to be desired but has some good options. I ordered the Lana Turner fish fillet, it came with a generous piece of cub topped with a puree and cheese. Very tasty, it reminded me of the famous cod in the cream of Portugal. Prices in the range of R $ 70.00 for individual Parati, but if the hunger is not great, I believe they can eat two people. I recommend.\n",

We had half margherita, half 'Portuguese' (they make two flavors for pizza). Very good. The sandwich was a disappointment: I think it was supposed to be a spin on choripan (sausage with chimichurri) but it turned out to be hard to bite - a hard dry sausage with too much lemon on the sauce. Very cold beer. Will be going back for the pizzas, though!\n",

            "Good bakery, in a quiet location. Good service, variety of dishes, snacks and dishes. Nice bakery, quiet place. Nice selection of breads, snacks and other\n",
            "The restaurant's atmosphere is really pleasant. Beautiful decor and beautiful view of the city. The service is also ok. The big problem is the most important: the food. I was in a group of 8 people who ordered 8 different dishes, in addition to varied starters and everything we ate was too weak. Really disappointing for a restaurant so talked about. No one at my table was satisfied. On top of that, prices are above average. It really isn't worth it, unless it's just to have a drink with that incredible landscape.\n",
            "An excellent tavern to have a drink with the crowd, music of different musical tastes and affordable prices.\n",
            "Excellent order, maintains a standard of quality and quantity.\n",
            "In my opinion one of the best in Salvador.\n",
            "I prefer the stewed dishes (without tip) that can come with beaten seasoning. It is worth asking for delivery the portion of acaraje with shrimp which are very tasty.\n",
            "Shrimp, fish and Siri stew are good options.\n",
            "Good service, attentive waiters, a lot of attention to the menu prices at the mouth of Rio, because I already had a problem with the bill.\n",
            "Menu with a price and a bigger one, of course.\n",
            "A must visit for those who know João Pessoa, both for lunch and dinner. What is difficult is not wanting to eat everything!\n",
            "The Pub has an excellent draft beer menu, both in terms of types and prices, catering to all audiences who wish to have a good quality craft beer.\n",
            "\n",
            "In addition, the dishes are very delicious. In my opinion the highlight was \"salmon with mashed yams\". In addition, the pastel is great too.\n",
            "\n",
            "The service is excellent too. All waiters are polite and patient when it comes to explaining the chopps being served.\n",

            "You choose the cut of the meat and the accompaniments are passed in a cart\n",

            "Great to go with friends, chat, have a wine.\n",
            "There is only one problem, the place is small and quickly sells.\n",

            "If we go to a steakhouse, we want to eat meat of great quality - and that Freio de Ouro knows how to do. Very good!\n",
            "The service, cordial. Score.\n",
            "But we always have options of salads and other foods to accompany - and in this regard, it needs to improve a bit.\n",
            "As for desserts ... I suggest that if you are going to do it, do it well! Too bad !!!\n",
            "Very good! We were very well attended by Wellington and Cassiano at our family meeting 👏🏻👏🏻\n",

            "The environment is super nice and inviting, very good service and delicious food.\n",
            "It is well located (close to Av. Juscelino kubitschek and Av. Santo Amaro), making it easy to get there.\n",
            "Worth knowing!\n",
            "Think of a restaurant with a great food urge ?! That's exactly it! Delicious cuisine that leaves nothing to be desired in any savory or sweet dish! Extremely fair price where you can eat both sweet and savory dishes!\n",

            "Restaurant with modern decor, pleasant service, we stayed in the mezzanine, I just found the acoustics a bit bad due to the wide environment, pleasant view of the Lagoon. We ate the shredded ribs with Portuguese watercress and potatoes for dinner, and the main course a mignon medallion with about four fingers in height and a cheese crust at the right and juicy point of eating on your knees. Impeccable service,\n",
            "congratulations and long life to the restaurant.\n",
            "I always go and like it a lot. Great salads, excellent quiches, soups ... All the best. All that was needed was a delivery or a mini sandwich unit.\n",
            "The concept is interesting!\n",
            "The beers are cool!\n",
            "The menu is extensive, but the preparation leaves something to be desired. Even a simple french fries comes almost raw ... and it was not just a request, we tried again, the second came bad too.\n",
            "\n",
            "The service is terrible! Terrible!\n",

            "My wife and I have lunch regularly at the Penguin. It has just become an option with great cost benefit, because it is ALL you can eat at a very fair price. The food is delicious and varied and the service is always very fast.\n",
            "Very good, with a variety of salads, hot dishes, pies, quiches and desserts. Delicious food, well presented and seasoned on the spot. Air-conditioned and cozy environment.\n",
            "Self-service system per kilo from Monday to Saturday, on Sundays the price is fixed per person. I recommend.\n",
            "It is a common bar, just like the others in São Paulo. It has tasty portions. Great service, good place for happy hour.\n",
            "A great option in downtown São Paulo. A brand new place with very good food, great prices, good drinks (a good caipirinha and a fantastic mint lemonade). The place has Palestinian-Syrian refugees preparing food and drinks, good ingredients (good olive oil - Palestinian olive oil don't miss it!), Very nice customers and very good prices. I totally recommend it.\n",
            "Good food, lots of options for salads, meat and pasta. Small but well-organized place with fair price. Delicious juices.\n",
            "The best experience I've ever had at a steakhouse! If you are in Rio the Palace is a must! Best Experience Steakhouse!\n",
            "Perfect place. Great service, lots of variety and quality. I highly recommend it. Very beautiful place too\n",
            "Restaurant with great service and spectacular food. The price is right for what is offered, normal for a good restaurant. Some dishes serve 3 to 4 people like PARISIENSE, for example. I recommend consulting the waiter if you are in a group, as the dishes are really well served.\n",
            "I love New Dog! Open 24 hrs! Excellent for those who leave the club with that hunger! Order the potato with the sauce aside! Omelet with ham and cheese! Always spectacular service!\n",
            "I consider TZ coffee to be an excellent option in Leblon. Outside you can be attended by bringing your puppy. There are many options to choose from, with vegetarian options and good desserts too. It is a place to which I return frequently, it is always a pleasure. I recommend a gnocchi!\n",
            "I have known the restaurant for a long time, always with abundant and well-made food. When ordering one of its most traditional dishes, Filet Surprise, I came across a thinner filet than Bife de PF, a soggy and unsalted rice. I complained to the waiter and he just agreed with me shaking his head. A pity for a restaurant so traditional to surrender the lack of quality and with prices that are no longer fair. I don't have the courage to recommend it to anyone else.\n",
            "I really didn't like it. Neither me nor the other three who accompanied me. We ordered fish, the house specialty, and it left something to be desired. Dish without any arrangement, terrible appearance and without much flavor. As it is a well-commented restaurant, I didn't understand. I prefer to think I went on a bad day.\n",
            "Tradition when it comes to barbecue in Rio Branco, well located tradition for lunch and dinner has its own parking.\n",
            "Mandatory stop for all tourists in Maceió and also for the natives! Everything is delicious and with several dishes!\n",
            "You can find very tasty typical foods, with the advantage of being per kg, so you can try a little of everything. I loved the sirigado fish (photo). The super desserts are worth it, wonderful ... highlighting the super wet cashew brownie, coconut cake and banana pave, Nutella and white cream ... too TOP!\n",
            "Good menu, good lunch options with reasonable prices. Nice place. You can make a quick, quiet lunch without delay.\n",
            "Great food. The Pancetta with guava is divine. The test is mandatory. There was an owl to accompany the pig, so everything was perfect. I just didn’t really like the car. In addition to being weird in the presentation, he was apathetic in flavor. But the restaurant is spectacular. It's worth getting to know him.\n",
            "Delicious moqueca, year in and year out and they are still good there, very good service and I highly recommend it\n",
            "If you want to have an overview of the Northeastern food, from the meat of the sun to the buchada de bode, passing by the tapiocas, manioc bread and other snacks, go to Mangai. The restaurant is quite large, with kilo and a la carte options\n",
            "I already had great directions from the restaurant, but experience showed me that this is really something different. Wide variety of starters (delicious salads, portions of Japanese food); garnishes (many !!!) and, mainly, the best meat. The cuts are excellent, very tender meat, where you want it. Super efficient service! Highly recommend the experience!\n",
            "The best place to relax, have a bite and eat some snacks, I recommend everyone who wants to have fun and get out of the routine, check out the Pepper Bar!\n",
            "Beautiful environment, super well decorated in every detail. Perfect service and impeccable, tasty and very well served food.\n",
            "Fair price for the quality of what is served!\n",
            "Very good, it is already the second time that I visit this super recommended place, the best tapioca in Fortaleza.\n",
            "They also serve regional dishes.\n",
            "I was at the Deus é Fiel kiosk, be sure to try tapioca with shrimp cream and catupiry.\n",
            "It is worth to try the Varenique Sbagliato, delicious pasta with an even better sauce. A very varied wine list. Super nice place.\n",
            "I super recommend great quality and great service from the waiter adailton very attentive and kind to all customers of the restaurant .......\n",
            "It is worth trying the stuffed gnocchi, I suggest not ordering four cheeses with sauce, because it gets too heavy there, I usually order the Bolognese. When the dish arrives it looks like it is small, but when you finish eating, you realize that it is enough. If there are a lot of people or if you have time, it is better to order by phone and advance your order. They sell chilled pasta and sauces. A pity that does not open on weekends, the restaurant, only open the sale of pasta.\n",
            "Excellent restaurant !! I am always tempted to order a burger but when I get the menu ... no chance I go for the dd chorizo ​​steak with fries and salad !!! I recommend!!!\n",
            "I went to this pizzeria recommended by a friend. When I got there, I was well received.\n",
            "The place is beautiful cozy.\n",
            "The environment is perfect for those going with children. But, the prices are high and do not match the quality of the product offered.\n",
            "I ordered a big pizza. The dough was so thin and the filling so little that you could see the bottom of the pizza. I was so excited to eat quality pizza and was disappointed. As it is a pizza factory, I thought it would be something different.\n",
            "I called the manager to complain: I was polite and courteous. He simply listened to me was silent and did not give me an answer to my complaint.\n",
            "You just ignored me.\n",
            "I was disgusted. Even the corner pizza here near home is better.\n",
            "I don't go back there and I don't even recommend anyone to go.\n",
            "Very delicious food with exotic ingredients and attentive waiters. Differentiated seasoning and a tasty mix of fruits with seafood. However the prices are absurd and definitely do not match the structure of the place. Very simple atmosphere and moldy bathrooms. Anyway, it was a good experience but the cost benefit is low.\n",
            "the food is not expensive and I found the dish I ordered delicious ... I'm going back. I don't have much to say, but you have to fill 100 characters ....\n",
            "Excellent restaurant, varied menu, wonderful food, the view is sensational, it has its own beer that should be tried.\n",
            "Tokio has the best temakis, with great variety and at totally affordable prices. Before going to Tokio, I had gone to several other themes and there was always something I didn't like about Tokio, everything is perfect, from the environment to the service.\n",
            "Super recommend !!\n",
            "I wrote a review here 4 years ago (2014). I decided to give this place another try (2018). And, God, it's even worse than before. Now their combination is less, the salmon is horrible (not the salmon), Temaki is RIDICULOUS (the seaweed is as dry as a biscuit, a lot of cream cheese), sushi with chips is horrible, but sushi with Nutella must be considered crime. And the service, oh, the service. . . It is as horrible as 4 years ago. Perhaps worse: they took centuries to respond, I ordered wasabi 3 times and never got it. But the price, oh yes sir, is really expensive if you consider the average in this region. Try again in 4 years, maybe? No way.\n",
            "We were surprised by delicious food, where we were in a group of 10 people! There were diverse dishes, such as fish, seafood and meat! Everyone loved their dishes. I took the Trilogia do Mar, where came a sea bass with a crust of cod salt and rice with squid (it looked like a rizzoto). Simply delicious. Perfect seasoning. The fish's crust was sharp and very tasty! Whoever is in Natal (Ponta Negra) can't help but try!\n",
            "For the price that is charged for the pizza, expect much more than it came. In addition to the delay in service, and delivery of the order.\n",
            "I have known Siqueira Grill since the early 90s, because I was living at that time on Rua Siqueira Campos. In all these years, whenever I am in Rio de Janeiro, I have to go there. And the quality is maintained in all these years because I was there in September 2012. The place is also very pleasant.\n",
            "Wide, beautiful, elegant environment, varied food, taking advantage of the climate and the beautiful beaches. Good service, however the meats were with salt well beyond the ideal.\n",
            "Crowded restaurant, with waiting line. Fortunately, it didn't take long for us to settle down. Wonderful broths. Excellent main dishes. The dessert- petit gateau, left something to be desired. But in general, very good. Best price.\n",
            "Great restaurant. Excellent service. We savor the Amazonian Piarucu - a very good dish, very tasty and well served fish. Many options on the menu, which makes the choice difficult. The same goes for desserts that are a must. I loved the banana kid's foot and the petit gateau with Cupuaçu filling. Delicious.\n",
            "Wonderful trinks, the tasting menu is plentiful and the desserts are to leave anyone impressed! Simply sensational ...\n",
            "I love everything here. Dinner is spectacular, the dessert (Argentine dulce de leche pancake with dulce de leche ice cream) divine and the perfect service! It's really worth it!\n",
            "Very good!! Food well done, an extensive steak and a lot of variety! But they are very ‘conservative’, they never change the steaks! As I go on it every two months, I already got sick of the food!\n",
            "I went to a friends birthday at the hostel's restaurant.\n",
            "We stayed in a reserved space with approximately 30 people. However only 1 waiter attending the reservation.\n",
            "Sophisticated, beautiful place with beautiful dishes too.\n",
            "We ordered a carpaccio of meat, but had no\n",
            "We ordered a white fish ceviche, very tasty and well served (for a couple), priced at 40 reais.\n",
            "Then we ordered a board of seafood, the board costs R $ 98.00 but it is flooded with potatoes, mushrooms and onions, much more potatoes than seafood. It doesn't pay.\n",
            "Their dishes are served with plenty of potatoes, even too much, at the end of the night there was no lack of potatoes on the table. They should decrease the amount of potatoes and increase the amount of seafood, for example.\n",
            "I ordered two APAs Colorado, but both came hot, I ordered a cooler beer, but they came with an ice bucket.\n",
            "There is a minimum consumption of R $ 50.00, but no guest has been notified.\n",
            "As I was just a waiter, it took me 20 minutes to get my bill paid.\n",
            "I found the place beautiful with friendly waiters, but I found it expensive for the options.\n",
            "This is one of the outstanding restaurants in Campo Grande. Intimate atmosphere, lean menu and very well executed.\n",
            "The wine list is small and has declined since the last time I was at the place, but still with good variety, despite the very high prices.\n",
            "But the highlight is the restaurant bar, with several drinks very well executed.\n",
            "I recommend trying the Moscow Mule! The best I've ever tasted. It is excellent!! Even though R $ 26.00 the caniquinha.\n",
            "In short: you eat very well, but you also spend well (price-quality ratio debatable)\n",
            "The differential is the Moscow Mule 👍 that yes, must be tried at least once in your life.\n",
            "I've been to the cosiness of Rio a few times. The food is very tasty, especially the famous feijoada cake. The main dish, I highly recommend the Shrimp Bobó, which by the way gives to three adults with moderate appetite. The beer list is also quite cool. You have to arrive early on the weekend to avoid having to queue, which can take a long time.\n",
            "A good environment and good cost benefit. Delicious food and desserts, wonderful service, restaurant specializing in meat.\n",
            "Best Italian food in town, first class service, very good wine list, I always recommend\n",
            "Standard hamburger restaurant, has several options of dishes well served, but the service is confusing and time consuming. From time to time the attendants sing and dance to American rockabilly music.\n",
            "I recommend the spaghetti with spettaculo d'uva and polpettone sauce. Very attentive waiters. They have cold blankets available to customers.\n",
            "I found the bar restaurant quite common in appearance, but everything we ordered was excellent. Manioc cake with shrimp, fried sardines, fish sauce and a praying crab. Good prices, excellent service.\n",
            "The atmosphere is beautiful, but the whole experience was at least disappointing. We chose to assemble the sandwich itself, and from there everything went pretty much. They did not put 2 of the chosen ingredients in one of the sandwiches, when we questioned the waiter said that one of them had really been forgotten but that the other had not been ordered. We insisted that we had asked and the waiter always denied it. When we asked to see the paper on which we marked the options, the waiter said he had lost. The only solution presented was to discount the value of the accompaniment that he admitted to forgetting you. In addition, I chose pickles in mine and ONE piece of pickled cucumber came.\n",
            "At the time of the account more disappointments. The waiter had informed us that the starting price of the assembled hamburgers would be 29 reais, but they charged us R $ 34, and the 350ml beer costs 19.90 !!!!! I couldn't put the CPF in the note, because the system was not registered and 2 hamburgers with side dishes and a beer cost an abusive R $ 102.94 .... I don't recommend it to anyone!\n",
            "Welcomed by a friendly Bahian woman with typical costumes. Attentive waiters, quick service. Well-prepared and tasty dishes. Careless bathroom.\n",
            "I've been there a few times but this last one was a killer. I asked for a starter, meat tartar, and for the second time it came poorly prepared, with the meat full of nerve and tallow. The result is that my fiancee and I spent more than 24 hours very sick with a very strong infection. I made sure to notify the owner who apologized to me. I don't intend to go back. We were 6 people and 4 got sick\n",
            "Menu with several options and impeccable dishes since the presentation. Great wine options and fair price!\n",
            "I eat the salad with the chosen vegetables every day, the chosen meat is very tasty and light.\n",
            "Very good food, pasta, risotto, meat, sauces ... all fresh and wonderful! Cheg Juarez is the best chef of victory, well worth knowing\n",
            "I was on a trip with my wife and went during promotional hours, with tickets coming out at 35% discount and beer at 50% discount. I recommend this restaurant for seafood lovers. Super cozy atmosphere and very polite staff.\n",
            "We drank a strawberry snow with a bean broth that was undoubtedly spectacular in flavor and a crab coat that had great seasoning, although a little crunchy.\n",
            "The waiters were very attentive getting a table facing the sea .. sorry that there was no time to try more .. Excellent to go with the family!\n",
            "Beautiful, airy place, excellent service, beautiful public. We went on a Sunday. Soon the lounge only worked and after 17:00 the pagoda started.\n",
            "Loved it. Very good. No defects. Good food, impeccable service. Even for children it is advisable. In short: I would always go.\n",
            "I believe that when we talk about sushi by Cleber, we are talking about the best of Porto Alegre! I love the atmosphere and I'm a fan of the full buffet! The options are many and everything is deliciously well prepared! Temakis, yakisobas and all kinds of sushi are present in the full buffet! I also think it's great that, for those who don't like Japanese food, they have the option of hot dishes, such as steaks, fish and pasta. I think the tip of making a reservation to sit at the short tables is valid. They comfortably hold 04 people. We already sat among six people there, but it got a little cramped. The wine list is top!\n",
            "I went to the restaurant with my husband and we were very well attended by Antonio.\n",
            "The meat was wonderful. So soft, I didn't even need a knife.\n",
            "Going to João Pessoa and not going to Mangai is going to the beach and not taking a shower. You have to go to taste the typical regional food. In addition to the excellent service.\n",
            "A while ago it was the best burger, but lately the quality is dropping a lot, especially the order I made for delivery.\n",
            "Located in the United Nations, this restaurant offers top-notch cuisine ranging from fish to beef, cold beer, ice cream with ample parking and disc delivery. I recommend, there is only one problem for being too close to the avenue I prefer to ask to eat at home, I would not eat there because it is open and there is a lot of dust from passing cars\n",
            "Large, airy and quite pleasant.\n",
            "One of the few places in Goiânia that you are served without having to beg the waiter to serve you. We arrived and were promptly attended to.\n",
            "It is expensive, but the service pays off the investment.\n",
            "I ate the Palette jammed and found it very sickening so sweet (for my taste right)\n",
            "Now, in isolation, the palettes themselves are a delight especially those of nest milk! To lick your lips\n",
            "Tucuruvi is probably one of the best steakhouses in Belém, it is not as cheap as I would like but it is very worth it, excellent meats, very well done side dishes. For those who appreciate a good meat is my suggestion!\n",
            "Few people know this restaurant, which always guarantees a free place during the busy lunch hours in downtown Rio. The food is good, with a variety suitable for the price, but the difference is the comfort of the large lounge with white tablecloths at the table, without lots of noise, thanks to the high ceilings and thick walls of this old and traditional building on Rua México.\n",
            "We went to the Leblon shopping mall's Abraccio. 4 adults and 4 children (10, 12, 13, 14 years). Good atmosphere, and courteous and very friendly service, a little confused with many attendants serving at the same time! Good food but I missed more options with tomato sauce; a lot with white sauce etc. The complimentary starter roll is delicious. The individual dishes came well served, but with a different size pattern. The dish to share serves two people. I don't recommend it for three adults. The children's penne dish is an insult! R $ 24.00 for a dish with less than 100g of pasta, only! I suggest reviewing the price or the dish! I found it strange when the waiter said he could not serve the food on the plate because he also received money ... However, he brought the dishes to the table, including cutlery and utensils. I also suggest more wine options, including national and Italian labels!\n",
            "The restaurant is pleasant, very attentive waiters but the cod (shredded) very bland. The potatoes didn’t taste like anything, they didn’t look like they were cooked in the fish’s desalting water, the cod looked like it hadn’t even been passed through garlic with olive oil. Like a chocolate mousse for dessert it was ok.\n",

            "The two or three times I went to the cafeteria to eat sandwiches, my bread came withered. I noticed that it is not an isolated problem of the store, but of the Bob's chain. I do not recommend!\n",
            "Spacious ambience and very diverse and tasty food ... a little high value, but worth it! I recommend!\n",
            "Restaurant by the sea on the edge of Pajuçara with the exclusive, authentic and delicious shrimp gum.\n",
            "Restaurant located in the neighborhood of manaíra, close to \"quadra de manaíra\", focuses on healthy eating serving salads, juices and crepes. The service is not so agile, sometimes requests take a while, but nothing worthy of a big complaint. It has a refrigerated environment and a more open space, the first being much smaller than the second. I recommend\n",
            "Perfect restaurant. Impeccable decor, waiters in character. Meal per kg or a la carte. We went for lunch and opted for self service, lots of variety, and great food. The price is a little high but it is worth it for the quality. I highly recommend it. Whether in Natal, you can't miss it.\n",
            "Very pleasant and romantic atmosphere, we were very well attended, the dishes well prepared and tasty. If you don't like long lines, make a reservation or get there early.\n",

            "Anyway, all very good ....\n",
            "this restaurant is in front of Meireles beach, there is another one called Coco Bambu Meireles that is in the Varjota neighborhood far from the beach. The internal environment is very well decorated with 2 floors, we prefer to stay outside watching the sea, it was a bit tense due to a work being done by the city hall on the boardwalk, with a lot of noise and dust. We ordered the carne de sol with cream rice, excellent and good quantity for 2 people. The menu is mouth-watering, has several dishes with shrimp and lobsters. The waiter's service was very good, the preparation of the dish was quick despite it being lunch time and the restaurant was packed.\n",
            "Top-notch restaurant on the ground floor of the Sheraton. I ate there for several days and every day the meals were great. Some days with a complete buffet to serve, which does not prevent you from ordering any grilled from the kitchen. And there are days where dishes are ordered individually. Optimal service and quality. Fair price for what they offer.\n",
            "It is not cheap, but it is worth every penny. One pasta better than the other, wonderful antipasto buffet and many good wines. It's a little time consuming. The place is small, you will probably have to wait for a table. But it's divine!\n",
            "The live music and the view make everything more beautiful. But the bar itself is very poor. Few appetizer options. Even without being full, orders take time. Today the chicken was clearly raw inside and complaining is useless. The beer is always cold and since it's close to home, I can handle it.\n",
            "Unfriendly service, it seems that customers are in need of them and not the other way around. They serve the meal as if you were at their home. Warm food. The taste ... is that of Habibs.\n",
            "Wonderful service from the waiter Abreu, specular food. Very good atmosphere and wonderful music 😘😘\n",
            "The line lives up to its name: Casa Cheia. And if the house is full it is because the food is good and the beer is super cold. The space is small but the heart is big, stools arrive and everyone fits at the table. I ordered the canjiquinha with pork ribs - Sensational. When I return to BH, I will definitely return and repeat the same dish. Worth it!\n",
            "Simple and delicious food. The place is also simple and not sophisticated. However for the price and service it left a lot to be desired. The Rodizio that the house presents is the basics of Cuiabana food and still lacked some options. I believe that the house should improve.\n",
            "Affordable location, good food and spectacular service. A reasonable wine list. With prices consistent with the location, I recommend.\n",
            "We like this recipe very much, it is undoubtedly the best we've eaten to date. My favorites are: Cheese, meat and mixed chocolate.\n",
            "Well located location, easily accessible at Getúlio Vargas before the entrance to Rua do Ouro in Serra. The food was reasonable, I expected more. Good service. On Tuesdays there is a ticket promotion for those who consume alcohol. The children's dish is good, but it cannot be served to the adult. Well decorated and pleasant.\n",
            "Excellent service and all sushi very good !!!!!\n",
            "We went by car and also ordered a piece of a la carte! Everything of excellent quality and flavor!\n",
            "Good price! Dishes well served! I just think there should be an accompaniment with the dish instead of having to pay the part. Nice place to have lunch while waiting for your flight time :)\n",
            "I was disappointed with the crab pot entrance, the one at Quiosque Giramundo in Tambaú is infinitely better. The pot of dried meat, manioc cream and rennet cheese and perfect mozzarella. And as for the main dish, seafood plate, it only accompanies rice with broccoli and vegetables on the plate itself, an expensive dish, approximately 144 reais, but for those who enjoy it, it’s very worth it and a jar of strawberry juice that looks like a smooth excellent in addition to a good order, and to finish order dessert Nau, vanilla ice cream with divine chocolate mousse (and it looks like I don’t like chocolate) and pieces of brown and roasted cocoa, large glass for two people. Salt account more than 220 reais more was worth too much. A gastronomic extravaganza is always good on a trip. But I still liked the Canoa dos Camarões Restaurant more. See my comment there.\n",
            "Excellent food, prepared in front of customers, great juices, pleasant atmosphere, very attentive owner, friendly and quick valets.\n",

            "\n",
            "Absurd to tell me they didn't have 1/2 a dozen oysters, just a dozen (!?!?) When the menu was half a dozen.\n",
            "\n",

            "It tastes well served and tasty and cold beer!\n",
            "Restaurant that is not new, but pleasant. The only problem is in the time of heat, which gets very hot. But it has the best picanha, the best boneless chicken and the best paçoca in Teresina. It's worth it too !!!!\n",
            "One of the best kilo buffets in the Bom Fim neighborhood - remembering that in Porto Alegre if you start at the kilo and exceed the free price you have the advantage of only paying the free price.\n",
            "Bad kare. Drain, saved. What I do at home doesn't compare. For a place that says kare house is a shame.\n",
            "Very good! I was very well attended, very good food and at an affordable price. In addition, super nice environment! 100%\n",
            "What is least found here is soup. In truth it is a bar in whose Atalaia unit serves a very cold beer at the lowest price in the region. As for the snacks, I just didn't like the green broth - tasteless - but the sururu broth and the skewers are great! Ah! On Friday and Saturday night there is live music, although the singer, despite not being all bad, was not memorable.\n",
            "Taberna has just opened. Very beautiful, all brand new, open kitchen, well-known chef. The menu is very interesting, but expensive. The weak point: the service. Although nice, I had to ask several times to serve the wine (do not put buckets on the tables to cool); in some moments, as it happens in all Terra Brasilis, waiters turned from the coast to the lounge, or so concentrated on some tables that they forget the rest of the world. For what they charge, it should be much better in that regard. And the owner was there, but service provision, unfortunately, is terrible in all areas of services.\n",
            "Very good prawn bobó, real crab shell (rare thing in São Paulo), good octopus rice. Different and delicious caipifrutas.\n",
            "It presents a very varied menu, with options to please the most diverse palates. It also has an executive dish for lunch, a good choice.\n",
            "Unfortunately, currently, they only open from Friday for lunch.\n",

            "The variety is good. The salads were very tasty and the rest of the food was reasonable.\n",
            "During the week (when prices are more affordable) it may be a good option. On Sunday I think it does not have good cost / benefit.\n",

            "Typical northeastern restaurant! Wonderful decoration, since the entrance already presents characteristics of the northeast. It has a self service buffet and other à la carte options! Very tasty food and lots of variety! Be sure to try the sun meat in the cream and the bread on the plate with cream! Tapioca is also tasty! In addition to the food, there is also a small shop at the entrance to the restaurant where we can find some decorative objects, cachaças and condiments typical of the northeastern hinterland!\n",
            "Small, tasty place, with few tables ... for those who like special beer, the menu there is huge and they even offer beer drinks. The fries and the burger are great! Worth the visit!\n",
            "Meat pasties with complimentary pepper jam. Cuxá rice with yellow hake is a great option.\n",
            "The restaurant is small, but very cozy. It is located in a gastronomic region of Leblon. On the menu you can find pasta, risottos and meats, as well as divine entrees and desserts. For chocolate lovers, I recommend the Belgian chocolate fondant with strawberries ... It's just wonderful !! Filet mignon stuffed with brie cheese is my favorite dish. And on top of that, the price is great.\n",

Guaranteed success !!\n",
            "Very cold beer, fast and great service by the staff, very nice place, very well done dishes. Men's bathroom too small for the establishment, needs to increase a little more; Most expensive tent on Flamengo beach but the best!\n",

            "The restaurant attracts by the good food and reasonable price. However, there was a very high readjustment and it became expensive. The waiters are attentive although it takes a while for the dishes to be ready. The bad note in the environment is because a year ago I celebrated my birthday there are two people fell, one getting seriously injured in need of undergoing surgery, due to the fall in an access step. To this day, there is no sign to draw attention to this step. I don't intend to go back.\n",
            "The atmosphere is great and the food was well prepared. The environment and the view are great and what really saves is the view. I think there are better foods for the same price.\n",
            "I had been to Mani three times. It is a very pleasant place in a wonderful area in São Paulo. I would like to say that the Restaurant and the Chef is more famous than the food. Like all kinds of business relationships and good press around the world, they make a difference. To prove that I would definitely say that Mani is absolutely average. For technics food lovers it is not the most important to have a final result. Now she is the best chef in the world (2014), but this is not my opinion for the food. Either way you should try it and check your experience instead it is at the top !!\n",

Dry tomato buffalo mozzarella fungi and fillet strips served with some toast. .. I ask for a dish that two people can eat ... The price is right\n",
            "In parts: the service is great: attentive and efficient. The place has personality, with a strong \"chican\" inspiration, both in the decoration and in the soundtrack. The \"Mooca\" tour is worth it. Noted?\n",

            "The restaurant is a little far from the waterfront (easy to reach by car) but it is certainly worth the visit. The place is very charming and the food is excellent. The dishes are individual and cost around R $ 50.00 reais. We were in 06 people and all the dishes were well served and delicious. For those who like meat I suggest the Filete al Pepe Verde (fillet in wood sauce with green pepper and saffron risotto (wonderful). For dessert go with chocolate mousse with coffee syrup, there's no mistake.\n",
            "The atmosphere is very cozy, with low lighting and a beautiful view. Great for two or with the whole family.\n",

            "The Meireles branch is read! Because it was recently renovated, and they even made a kind of Pub, on the second floor, which has a good sound until the wee hours of the night.\n",
            "Regarding the dishes .... the only thing I can say is that everything that comes out of the kitchen is good!\n",
            "Defect: free parking for customers. I can't understand how Cocobambu charges R $ 10.00 for parking, if all customers consume at least R $ 200.00 / couple. Here's the tip!\n",
            "Other than that, it's all good!\n",
            "The information is different from that published on the site page. No information that closes at 11 am and that the restaurant and cafe does not work every day\n",
            "I liked the service and the good education of the employees, but I didn't like the sandwich I ordered very much. the meat of the hamburger had a \"past\" taste.\n",
            "maybe next time i'll have more luck!\n",
            "I discovered the boteco do França on my last day in Rio Vermelho and I was very sad for that. Delicious food, we ordered a stuffed breaded chicken accompanied by broccoli rice. I recommend. Fair price, nice atmosphere.\n",

            "I recommend the grocery store with my eyes closed! The dining experience in a restaurant as good as this one is really worth it!\n",
            "I recommend the visit, typical Arab food. The waiters are attentive, I just didn't like the cashier standing next to the sink that wash the dishes.\n",

            "Probably the best restaurant of typical Piauí food in Teresina. Pleasant atmosphere, friendly decor, very attentive staff. Excellent and hearty dishes, very special and delicious fruit juices from the region\n",
            "We went for a snack in the evening where for just R $ 19.90 (that's right, 19.90!), You can eat absolutely everything that is offered on the spot. They call it a snack, but it serves both as a snack and for dinner, since it ranges from food (couscous, pasta, pizzas, broths, meats, etc.) to breads, fruits, cakes, toast, etc. Not to mention that juices that are made from fruit savers are included in the price to be consumed at will, as well as coffee, milk and tea. I swear I didn't believe it, especially for me that I live in Niterói and work in Rio, that is, stratospheric prices. I tell everyone to go without fear. Customer service note 10 too!\n",
            "Tasty food! Wide variety of regional dishes. Meats of all types, but the highlight is the meat of the sun. The best I've ever eaten in my life!\n",

            "Most of the restaurant is literally in the middle of the mall, which does not guarantee much privacy. Despite this, I left satisfied with the dishes (Filet ao Porto and Filet Formaggio, R $ 57.00 each), generous portions and very tasty. My only complaint was the point of the meat that came differently than requested in one of the dishes. Good service and the beer was cold. I recommend\n",
            "We arrived, we stayed a long time waiting for the waiters to be outside talking. It was just the beginning of a service that left something to be desired from beginning to end.\n",
            "Portion of Lula was delicious, the hamburger that bears the name of the place dismounted to eat in hand, and the board to eat did not provide comfort to eat with cutlery. Spice of the hamburger very weak, little sauce (just a brush stroke on the bread). My friend ordered a macaroni stuffed with brie cheese, which was not available, so she asked to make only the pasta change and to keep the sauce, which was just but also not exactly tasty. My orange juice and her juice came out watery (the orange one came overly watery).\n",
            "\n",
            "At dessert time, chesecake was very tasty, the basket of churros not so much.\n",
            "\n",
            "The bill came close to 3 digits for each of the two, which I don't mind paying, but the experience was certainly not worth it. I don't intend to go back\n",
            "Typical Italian canteen in Copacabana. Reasonable prices. Good service. Good food. Fresh pasta. Good option.\n",
            "We went to Ponte Nova on a Sunday for lunch. We reserve a table for 8 people (the reservation only goes until 1:00 pm). The place was full, so it's best to book early if you don't want to wait in line.\n",
            "\n",

            "\n",
            "The food is excellent. It was the most delicious dish of Boa Memória 2017 I have ordered so far, Porquinho Lá e Lô. The others were the tuna sealed with jasmine rice (much praised) and the filet mignon with linguini.\n",
            "\n",
            "We ordered a starter that was not served, asparagus with bacon and eggs. We waited, but the waiter ended up bringing the main dishes. Despite this, the service was good.\n",

            "2 medium baião (without seasoning) and a Portion of mini kibbeh with sun meat that came up reasonable.\n",

            "It is located in the Gávea shopping mall, which facilitates parking and is a pleasant mall. It is a great place with good service and pleasant decor. Besides you can make a snack (there are tartlets, breads and quiches) it also has a menu for lunch / dinner. However, what I use most at DRI is the delivery service - the burger with rustic potatoes is my favorite dish! They arrive warm and with great presentation. It is not cheap but it is worth it.\n",
            "Excellent meat option in Barra da Tijuca, after the beach. It is located on Avenida Ayrton Sena. The steaks are excellent and the service is impeccable. In addition, it has Japanese food and you can even order special \"fresh food\", freshly made, such as cod, brie cheese with apricot, etc.\n",

            "I'm a hamburger addict and I've never had one as good as Porpino's! 🖤 ​​The menu is not extensive, you can taste all the burgers in a good way. The house also has the option to add ingredients, so every time you go you can \"invent\" a different burger. My tip is the bluecheese with bacon and a very cold pink lemonade! Not to mention the beautiful atmosphere, cool music and perfect service! 🖤\n",
            "The place is very cozy, the hamburgers are made with great ingredients, the price is good. It is our favorite place nearby.\n",
            "I visit often and never let me down. It has excellent service and the owner, Selma, is super attentive to everyone. Try the meat kebab with chestnuts! Worth it.\n",
            "Bar very well located, with great options to take away tastes and tasty beers from Bäcker. If you don't want to get in line, get there early; the bar is not big and is always full.

            "Bazkaria is a delicious pizzeria located near the Parcão, in Porto Alegre. It has traditional flavors and different flavors. It is worthwhile to go there and taste the different ones, since it is the differential of the place. I emphasize that the flavors I like most are Bilbao and Biarritz. To accompany, we always opt for sangria, which is extremely delicious. There's no equal!\n",
            "Top quality service by our friend Gleice, a place with great dishes and top quality live music\n",
            "The restaurant is very well located, half hidden, looks small on the outside, but it is very large, very well decorated, very pleasant atmosphere, excellent service, very good wine list, with several options and the best: the food! The best sushi in town! The fish is fresh, the chef's style was our order, it came assorted and diversified, one tastier than the other! I highly recommend it!\n",
            "As is customary in all Coco Bambu chain restaurants, Teresina also leaves something to be desired! Great location, perfect food with several options of salads and drinks! The price is higher than the others, but the quality offered deserves every penny spent more!\n",
            "The coffee offered by the hotel is affiliated with deck 18, I thought the coffee was good and with a lot of variety, the food is neat and the service is also good, what choosing the hotel sometimes was due to breakfast\n",

            "Excelent reception. Pleasant environment.\n",
            "Despite being an Italian restaurant, I found it particularly unoriginal. Similar to several other Italian restaurants: Carpaccio, caprese salad, funghi, etc ... it didn't present me with anything really new. However, what I ordered was tasty.\n",
            "If I had option 3.5 on TripAdvisor this would be my grade.\n",

            "The most similar pizza to the original Naples we've ever eaten! Light pasta, tomato sauce directly from Italy and the best quality ingredients! My favorite pizza is the classic Margherita Verace. The starter burrata is also wonderful and the dessert canolli is amazing!\n",

            "Service ok (despite some delay in the dishes) and very cold beer (there are no special beers). The termite dishes on the tile are good, but they could be better served and the termite reaches the table warmer.\n",
            "The termite cookie saved the night.\n",
            "I really liked it. Service note 10, mayor beach. Very good for a well deserved rest. As it is close to the airport and if you have a long connection, go there from UBER.\n",

            "Dishes with high values ​​and poorly served. We ask\n",
            "Spaghetti with four cheese sauce and a portion of fries. Spagheti was good. Now the portion of fries was a joke. It was barely enough for 1 person. The amount was less than those served at Mc Donalds (small). I asked the waiter if it was a portion at all. But I didn't complain more sharply because I know that the waiter, a young worker, is not to blame for the owner's greed. I don't recommend it and I will never come back.\n",
            "This restaurant was impressive - we had a table that I felt was in a tree house! Although the waiters spoke very little English, the service was excellent. The food was very good without being incredible, but it was worth going just to eat in such an unusual place. We take a taxi there, but be warned, there are no taxis when you want to go home! However, the restaurant has some cars of its own and will assign you one, if you ask, in a long time. If you are in Rio, definitely go to this restaurant, although this is a little out of the way.\n",
            "Great food and look! The Lagoon is a separate show! And the coolest thing is that you have a vegetarian option. I loved everything! For children it is perfect !!!\n",
            "With a very pleasant atmosphere, Vignoli offers excellent pizzas and pastas (I recommend \"Vignoli\" and, as dessert, excellent brie cheese with apricot) and great service. The price is reasonable, but if you are really hungry, prepare to leave a few extra bucks, because with the thin pizza dough (and the quality of the fillings) it is easy to eat a big one alone!\n",

            "Simple food but original home made Lebanese dishes. I had the all inclusive lunch, which was actually quite limited compared to many other all you can eat options at similar restaurants. But the food was tasty and original. The place is simple, unpretentious and in the center of the city.\n",
            "It is a good option for those with limited budget there in the region of Augusta rs.\n",
            "Always like the pastry, but this week I was disappointed to order a pizza and come with tomato sauce, instead of the tomato itself. I know we are in crisis, but we are not going to overpower, right?\n",
            "Careless and very cordial service. I couldn't stay to try the cuisine, I don't do a favor for an establishment that mistreats a customer. Honestly, the food can be excellent but I will not be returning and do not recommend it.\n",
            "Going to the renewed Pinheiros market, be sure to stop by .... despite the long line, it's worth it. The portions are good, except for the cheviche, which is very tasty, but you may need to accompany it so you don't get hungry ....\n",
            "The first time I went I had Siri pudding and shrimp stew with octopus! The second time, my daughter asked me to take her to eat maniçoba, her favorite dish, as a children's day gift. Excellent food and service. I definitely intend to go back!\n",

            "Mandatory stop in Natal. During lunch, in addition to the spectacular meal, it offers a view of the sea. The portions are always huge. Whether for the pastel or for the shrimp dishes.\n",
            "One of the most traditional meeting points for Amazonian intellectuals. It's for drinking beer. There is a traditional sandwich, but the fame does not match reality. It is a mandatory stop for those who want to know the soul of the city.\n",

            "I wonder if I went to the same restaurant that so many people speak well of. The puppy was reasonable, but not even far from justifying the price charged. Hake is a tragedy. Attentive attendants, unfortunate presentation of dishes. Not to come back.\n",

            "Great service, but did not have so many options that you would expect from a free buffet. Tasty dishes and includes dessert. Well seasoned price too!\n",
            "Bar and restaurant with a different and interesting proposal. I had a good experience getting to know the Amadis house. The place is nice, cozy, on the Friday we went there had live music. The difference is the service of the waiters and the boss himself going to our table. Nowadays it is rare to find this in bars and restaurants! Regarding food, impeccable. My boyfriend and I ordered chicken stroganoff pastries and then we ordered breaded rennet cheese, served with guava sauce. DELICIOUS!!! And for dessert we ordered I don't remember the name but it is a bowl with ice cream, Nutella, mousse, Oreo cookie, Kinder Bueno. I want to go back soon!\n",

            "The cozy atmosphere draws much attention. The service was quiet, the menu options varied. The pizza took a long time to arrive but it was certainly worth it! Delicious pizza. I was satisfied with the experience.\n",
            "We ordered a pizza through the app with a 1h delivery forecast. The estimated time was increased to almost 1h30m after the order time. We called in the restaurant and the attendant MENTIU when he informed that the order had already left, because we called in the service of the application (10 minutes after contacting the pizzeria) and informed us that the order was not yet on the way.\n",

            "The place is simple but the food is quite tasty. As the name suggests go from Carne de Sol to fashion, the dish is well served and can accommodate 3 to 4 people. It is quite crowded at lunch, important to plan to get a table.\n",
            "Everything was amazing, atmosphere, service, presentation of the dishes. I don't remember the name of the waiter who served us, but his recommendation was wonderful, I wanted to lick the rice dish with chicken (and look, I'm not even a chicken fan). It was one of the best foods I have tried to date. We were in 5, each ordered a different dish, so we could try a little of each, and everyone was exceptional. I can't wait to go back. It became my favorite restaurant in BH.\n",
            "I liked it before the renovation because it was more rustic. With the renovation and opening of the restaurant everything was chic but the quality of the products has not lost and the service from the staff remains excellent.\n",

We enjoyed traveling the world to have different experiences, I was surprised to find something so special and unique right here in Salvador where I have always lived. It is difficult to explain what I felt in this experience, it is all sensory. Very happy and grateful to Ramon and Gabriela for conceiving this place with its own soul and at the same time universal.\n",

            "Without a doubt the worst Japanese restaurant I have ever known. I went to Instagram where they post very appetizing photos of the dishes and I really regretted it. Starting with the environment that is lousy, dark, with the impression of dirty and with a strange smell. The service is horrible, the waitress was in a very bad mood and served us very badly, she didn't bring anything we asked for and the dishes we said we didn't need, she brought them. It was that he dropped the sushi on the table without even explaining what it was about. As for the food, it sucks. Worst Japanese food ever, sushi is very bad, the temaki we can't eat, all with an absurd (and sickening) amount of cream cheese. Terrible. Finally, I ordered the ice cream for dessert and without even asking me the ice cream (a lot of bad stuff too) came smeared with strawberry syrup and I hate syrup! In summary: I do not recommend, I will not be returning, I regretted having gone to eat there.\n",
            "Nice restaurant with a nice backyard. The starter dry pasties are excellent. The pacu with banana flour was extraordinary. I recommend.\n",
            "Great restaurant and great service from the somellier liomar perfectly harmonizing dish x wine. Congratulations not by chance being the best seafood restaurant 2x consecutive elected by Veja magazine.\n",
            "Very tasty food. Excellent service from the waiter Marcos, very attentive. We will be back more often.\n",
            "Very tasty restaurant with varied and differentiated rotation. Very good service, especially the waiter Cleiton who was very attentive. Valet and paid parking. Beautiful location. Waits for table, but organized service. I recommend and will be back.\n",
            "Nothing exceptional, but one of the best options in the region, nice location and ok service, a little crowded.\n",
            "I ordered the pork steak (which serves 3 people well, but can serve 4 people who don't eat much). And the famous shrimp in pineapple that serves 3 people well. But I confess that two hungry people can handle it too. DON'T FAIL TO ASK FOR THE FLOUR OF WATER, in case it doesn't come on the plate you asked for. The farofa is too thin, wonderfully delicious. We waited about 45 minutes. But it was worth it.\n",
            "Simply phenomenal. The best cod in town. Wonderful service, with waiters over 20 years in the establishment. I loved everything. Sensational wine list. Everything scores 10!\n",
            "The service is very good. Saturday takes a while because of the movement, but the food makes up for the wait. On Saturday there is a trampoline for children. It's a shame that it doesn't open on Sunday. Individual dishes cost an average of 20.00 reais and are well served. They don't use credit cards, only debit cards.\n",
            "A good place to enjoy good Italian food at affordable prices. They have a good menu and also have delivery.\n",

            "I went to celebrate my birthday again, I really like Fabbrica di Pizza because it always has children with us and this place has an incredible space for them, so we go and we are unconcerned because in addition to the playground being incredible, the monitors have fun activities in group with she. The menu is super complete, in addition to pizza several other wonderful dishes.\n",
            "We ordered grilled meats, rice, fried cassava and beans. The dried meats, there was not even a thread of oil. We don't like it! At lunchtime, little light.\n",
            "It is a good pizzeria. You do not have the option of delivery, you only attend the salon. This makes the price of pizza around 85 reais, jump because everything depends on the artistic cover. It's a band, ok, it's not even super cool for adults. Children will find the music very chatonilda, you can prepare. But let's focus on the pizza: perfect thick dough, quality ingredients - it doesn’t justify the price charged in my opinion, but it’s the famous name that raises the price - it’s not something “impossible to pay”, but it does weigh in your pocket in particular because it comes with this mandatory artistic cover charge R $ 18.00 per person.\n",
            "Good food at a fair price! It gets to be more affordable than many beach huts where the tourist is skinned ... Elegant place, with good taste and excellent service and sensational food. They do not charge 10% of the waiter ... but it would be unfair not to pay, so you can ask to include the service. I recommend!\n",
            "I love Pizza Park pizza. The thin and crunchy dough for me are the key points of the pizzeria. I suggest the flavors: four cheeses, catupiry, chutney, grana padano and marguerita! The only negative point is the price, which is a bit salty, but even so, there is an advantage over most pizzerias: when ordering a pizza of two values, the pizzeria, in my view, is fair, when charging half of each flavor and not the total value of the most expensive.\n",
            "Very good and varied food. Beautiful environment, beautiful decor. Offers parking. Easy access. The buffet is well assorted and offers an island of pasta. Service is good, waiters helpful and polite. The desserts are not on the same level as the rest. The price is very reasonable.\n",
            "Excellent service, great meat, good and varied buffet. The place is very beautiful, has ample parking\n",
            "Excellent structure, delicious food, polite waiters, especially. ..Gersom, Rafael, Nivaldo and Cleber, my sincere thanks to these four professionals in the 12 days I spent there\n",
            "It simply has the best Italian food in Fortaleza. Air-conditioned and spacious. I recommend it for family and business meetings, at any time.\n",

            "Delicious dish. I indicate to the friends I love.\n",
            "I've been to the peep a few times and I think the food depends on the chef's mood, because sometimes it's very good, but other times it's a disappointment! Prices are generally high, but at least the dishes are well served!\n",
            "Throughout the week there is an absolutely honest executive menu! Good value for money and the dishes are always striking. Very varied wine list. La Posta Blend is a good tip for lunch!\n",

            "It is located inside the new Shopping Cidade São Paulo, at Avenida Paulista, on the third floor in the Food Court. Delicious Arab food, warm and with a huge variety. They fill the trays all the time. With two options, kilo or even have the options of open spheres, R $ 5.50 a unit. I recommend the open cheese spread .. I loved it ...\n",
            "We went to celebrate my 24 year old daughter's birthday, she chose the restaurant so we went there to see it. For what appeared in the culinary programs criticizing amateur dishes, the message goes that I think yours were much to be desired, basic inadmissible mistakes as Helena Rizo speaks. We start with the rice risotto bomb with octopus; it was cold and look that the excuse for waiting 45 minutes was because of this dish! The risotto made to order! Small talk ... the risotto came cold and the octopus just warm (almost soft) and without seasoning. The pork rib on polenta was beautiful even with the disproportion between a square of rib and half a kilo of polenta (cold by the way too) and the most absurd was that the top of the rib was perfect, but the bottom was hidden by the the cook was a charcoal, literally 2mm thick charcoal, incomprehensible, the attendant saw it and asked if he could show the manager, who did absolutely nothing, nor did he even come to the table to apologize. !!! What an inelegant thing. the pupunha noodles with cheese sauce were without many defects except for the lack of flavor, who said that palm hearts cream and parmesan are enough ?. In my opinion something is missing. Fideuá with prawns was the most greasy dish I tried in a reasonable restaurant. Normal desserts regular chocolate cake with cinnamon ice cream (light cinnamon aroma) Expensive prices (for the size of the dishes served, expensive wines, start at one hundred reais which I think is a mistake in any restaurant. I will return to the original Mani because my memory of a dinner there is still in my sensational memory\n",
            "We had dinner at Lopana and had a pleasant evening, with live music. The kiosk offers good drinks (I had one for 10 reais, very tasty). Good food (my girlfriend loved a dish with prawns and plantain purees). Casa also offers great desserts.\n",
            "Very good restaurant! excellent food and for all tastes! good service. Small but comfortable place. It's a bit of a bad place to park like in the whole neighborhood, but it's worth it! The price is not expensive. There are things to take home too, they make some pasta and pies on the spot.\n",

            "A Delikatessen lady. You don't give anything away. Great wines and delicacies of this type of trade. Great service. Sommelier Frank teaches a class. And at the back of the house a balcony with a beautiful view of Perdizes to taste everything you sell in the store. Simple atmosphere with highly refined taste.\n",

            "> Now if you intend to eat a sweet ... Make the order and press the patience button because it will take until the chat with your friends runs out, but first ask the waiter to check in the kitchen if \"they are really\" making your dessert . I was surprised by the news that \"there was\" my dessert by the same waiter who had the other three orders ready.\n",
            "An unusual situation, like the ones we see on TV pranks, where an absurd event robs us of the reaction.\n",
            "The apology of the manager offering another complimentary dessert (employee arrived when my friends were already finishing their sweets), saying that the \"fault\" was the waiter (?) And that the inputs were missing (Cartola - a banana, a piece of cheese , cinnamon and sugar) were only able to put in unprepared letters in disguise dressed as finesse.\n",
            "Excellent service starting with the decor. Wonderful food and varied dishes. Price could be a little bit lower. Large and very clean place.\n",
            "Restaurant specializing in hamburgers, but with salad and pasta options. Well located in Itaim Bibi, with good service. The hamburgers are very good, with the option of FIT, vegetarian, quinoa hamburger, chicken and various sizes. The price is around R $ 33.00 to 39.00 depending on the requested supplements. I met Madero in Brasília and I really liked it, because the sandwiches are delicious. At least it's worth knowing.\n",
            "Service was a little confusing, as it seemed to me that the waiters fought each other to see who was going to serve and when he came to serve everything we asked about the pizzas this waiter did not know how to answer,\n",
            "Had Q\n",
            "Go ask others. He said he was new ... I believe that even new ones, they should be better prepared. After all, we were very hungry and we had to wait for this back and forth just to place the order. We ordered a shrimp pizza, which had the least shrimp ... I even think it should be called garlic pizza. It was the most horrible thing. Everyone only managed to eat the first slice and we already left with a breath of amazing vampire. If you're not passionate about EXCESS, point out that you want pizzas without garlic. It was impossible to eat.\n",
            "I had always heard of it and recently I went to lunch. Despite being somewhat hidden inside the museum, I liked the place. Buffet meal, good variety and quality.\n",

            "Great for those who want to try typical Acre food, like the famous tacacá. It is located in the Parque da Maternidade region, which today is experiencing an unprecedented abandonment, but as it is close to Avenida Ceará, the main one in Rio Branco, it is not so affected by the abandonment of the site.\n",
            "This restaurant serves the delights of the sea with an irresistible spice. The basement per dish is sufficient for the number of people indicated on the menu, very well served, and the customer service, although always full on weekends, is quite satisfactory.\n",

It has a blue area in front and is very close to other tourist spots in the city: Redenção, Brique and Araújo Viana.\n",
            "In this charming bar you can eat salami and various cheeses, have a good wine and chat. The atmosphere is very pleasant and the service is fast. I recommend homemade bread, as they usually come out warm from the oven. Avoid busy days to enjoy the region's silence.\n",

            "Considering the prices in the region, La Maison Restaurant is an excellent option for those who want to eat in the Atlantic without spending a lot. The giant Milanese is thin and delicious and the meat croquettes are the best I've ever eaten ... The place is very pleasant and the service is good, although sometimes a little slow. Order a beer and croquettes to start and relax.\n",
            "The place is beautiful! Super well decorated. There is a good variety on the menu, the starters are ok, but the fusion sushi, which should be the flagship is a disappointment! There was a salmon paste so salty, so salty, then came a sushi that tasted so bad that I was afraid of being ill later, with the taste of spoiled fish. The branch they serve, it was never a branch, nor the pasta is proper for that! Tasteless broth, the pork belly only had the fat ... anyway! It was a very unpleasant experience. I do not intend to return!\n",
            "It could give a maximum score, but there is only 1 waiter and basic hygiene items like liquid soap and paper towels are missing.\n",
            "Very good service ... Super attentive Antonio, delicious and fresh food ... WONDERFUL dessert\n",
            "The place is sensational, nothing to complain about, just praise, as the service is exquisite and the customer is very respectful, and the food is amazing.\n",
            "Caranguejo do Porto is a very nice place to eat and have a beer at night! It is located close to Farol da Barra and has a few other bars around. The service is good and the price is reasonable.\n",
            "I go weekly to Sushi Carioca. Fair price. The entrance (carpaccio) that they offer is wonderful!\n",
            "I was one of the first people to arrive on a Saturday. There was only one couple. So far it was pretty cool, but when a lot of people started arriving, it took a long time before we could sing again. But it's worth it, the atmosphere is really cool, a lot of music in the catalog ... it's fun!\n",
            "One of the most interesting pizzerias in Porto Alegre, starting with the small and comfortable environment, including the pizzas, served on a wooden board, cut to eat by hand. All with well developed and well made flavors. For the price you pay, a fantastic option in Cidade Baixa!\n",
            "There's no denying it, the food is excellent and always of very good quality, none of the dishes I've eaten have never looked bad. The drinks always very cold, the service very good, very attentive and very prompt. The atmosphere is low light, ideal for romantic couples, but for a happy hour with friends it is also ideal, pleasant music. Simply very good. I highly recommend it.\n",
            "The best codfish cake I've ever eaten and Camarao's hidden dish is spectacular !!! Super well seasoned, with lots of shrimp. Unmissable...\n",
            "Restaurant with a pleasant and air-conditioned environment. Very good location. Affordable price. Fast service for ordering drinks and desserts.\n",
            "Very good barbecue, the only problem is that you cannot arrive too late as you risk running out of the best meats.\n",
            "Pasta buffet freshly prepared in the style of Spoleto (very good).\n",
            "Kids space for the little ones. Problems with parking spaces but they opened up a parking space across the street that may improve.\n",
            "You pay R $ 65.00 at the carvery and have the opportunity to eat almost all types of dishes that include shrimp. It was my second time. Paid without pain in conscience. Great atmosphere and service.\n",
            "Very nice place, quality music. Impeccable service !!!!\n",
            "I recommend the entire menu. We went to the Festival. Sushiman haddock creations with authentic and perfect cashew slices !! Congratulations on the house\n",
            "Wonderful food, I recommend the Shrimp International, my favorite dish. I was attended by Darley, super attentive and polite. I recommend!!!\n",
            "Quiet place, exceptional service, wonderful food! A great place to take family, friends or even alone !! I became a customer!\n",
            "Good, beautiful and cheap. Nepalese and Indian food made with care, in a simple and unpretentious environment. There are always vegetarian options, lassi and typical desserts.\n",
            "The food and the atmosphere is very tasteful, the staff are very attentive and helpful, all restaurants in the franchise are very well located, in short, here is a restaurant that is really worth visiting.\n",
            "First it has to be said that this restaurant is worth a visit for its location. Facing the boats anchored in Marina da Glória and the most pleasant part of downtown Rio, both this and the other restaurants located there offer the surroundings as an additional attraction - and this is one of the reasons for the rating I have assigned to the restaurant . The food that is served there (cuts of meat in the Argentine way) is another point in favor, especially for meat lovers, like me. At the entrance we ordered chorizo ​​and empanadas, which were very good. The pieces of meat that followed as the main course - soft, tasty, grilled at the requested point - lived up to our expectations. The fried polenta and the farofa de ovo were also delicious. The service faltered at times, but without compromising the work as a whole. The price is a little steep, as is usual in restaurants in Rio, but it does not differ from the average of the houses in the industry. Making a final balance, it was worth it.\n",
            "A pity how much Krystal is decaying every day ... one hour the chopps are not cold, another the meat is bad ... anyway ... a pity. Yesterday, incredible as it may seem, although there are desserts on the menu ... when I ordered an ice cream (sunday) I was informed that the ice creams had run out; as well? My niece was accompanied by me and she was very disappointed .... and so on, every day a disappointment. The day will come, we won't be able to go back there! A feather! It seems that the new administrator is not very good with bars and restaurants.\n",
            "Delicious wow the tastiest sanduba in Fortaleza for sure price and quality with good service can go with family and friends\n",
            "Excellent place to meet friends, treatment and first class service. A place of easy access, safe and beautiful, I recommend without a doubt.\n",
            "No comparison with the Augusta version, which I hated when I went. This new bar is spacious, with an original decoration that resembles a saloon, cool crowd, top music, cool bands, delicious sandwiches, crispy chips and sequinhas, good service. The bathrooms are unisex, they were very clean, the most interesting thing is that the sound in the location of the bathrooms is enhanced, giving the impression that there is a ballad. Very nice, we like it and will be back!\n",
            "Best waiter service we've ever had. The chef checks the tables to see if the dish was good.\n",
            "What attracts us most is the ease of exchanging ingredients between dishes. for example, you can exchange a “sirigado” for another type of fish in the same sauce.\n",
            "I recommend ordering SALMON NATAN is excellent.\n",
            "located in the pvh mall, it has all kinds of high quality chocolate, a pleasant environment has chocolate for all tastes, I highly recommend it.\n",
            "I am privileged to live in Natal and be able to enjoy, when I want, the wonderful dishes! Despite being delicious and a very pleasant environment it does not become expensive, on the contrary, cost x benefit mara! Don't miss it!\n",
            "Really, really well served food. Dishes for two can eat three. With the air conditioning too strong, my plate quickly cooled. Friendly but nonchalant waiters, kind of with their heads on the moon. But nothing that can interfere so much in the final evaluation.\n",
            "I was curious and regretted it. It is not possible for a place to serve skewers, pizza and sushi and be good at all three. The sushi is terrible, the pizza is simple but it passes, and the skewers ... well, skewers are on any corner. The environment is extremely hot and noisy. In the end, it serves to eat until it gets clogged and comes out sorry.\n",
            "Nice food, with adequate ambient sound, fast and practical dishes and not to mention the waiter who attended to us, who was Abreu!\n",
            "pleasant atmosphere, good service and great dishes. The menu changes frequently. House water is complimentary.\n",
            "Very good, excellent service! Carvery with many options!\n",
            "It is the best Japanese food restaurant I have ever been to.\n",
            "Easy access and free parking during the week.\n",
            "We had five business leaders from different states, meeting\n",
            "For dinner. Each ordered and enjoyed a different meal, but dessert\n",
            "It was unanimously chosen: creme brulee with orange strips. Not many\n",
            "Wine options. The place is very clean and spacious, it has its own garage\n",
            "The back.\n",
            "pleasant space and atmosphere, ok drinks, tasty food, slow and dispersed service was lacking. We left disappointed.\n",
            "Quiet, exotic, ambient music, with good food. Good service. It is well worth the visit. We ate an executive menu at a fair price, embracing from the starter to the dessert, perfect!\n",
            "Pleasant place, beautiful view and top-notch service, with special attention to the maître Alvaro. Very good cod and excellent chocolate mousse\n",
            "The pizza is delicious and the restaurant makes periodic promotions offering double pizzas, which counts a very positive point.\n",
            "The chicken and catupiry pizza and four cheeses are excellent and, with a border, even better.\n",
            "I strongly recommend tasting the brigadeiro pizza, one of the best I've ever eaten.\n",
            "The price is right for the delivery service and quality of the pizza, a pity that the good trip unit doesn't exist anymore.\n",
            "That Paraense gastronomy is gaining more and more relevance, this is known by many. However, to the surprise of the people of Pará, gastronomic areas that are not part of this tradition have also been standing out in recent times.\n",
            "The case of the Porpino hamburger falls into this category, in which it is not simply a matter of eating a hamburger, but of enjoying one.\n",
            "Having the opportunity, go and try it.\n",
            "Good to go with friends and family! The typical Pernambuco food stands out. You can take the children because it has a reserved area! Great!\n",
            "I always come and I am always surprised by the service and the variety of the buffet, Carneiro with fine herbs sauce great. Perfect quinoa salad.\n",
            "Very tasty snack\n",
            "\n",
            "I chose what comes with parma ham with bacon and dijon mustard.\n",

            "\n",
            "Congratulations on the house\n",
            "Pleasant environment and with a beautiful view to the beautiful Madeira River (from where tons and tons of gold have been removed), fast service. Wonderful food tambaqui roasted on banana leaves, made and dried gold, baião, rice, flour, vinaigrette and lastly the caldeirada de dorado with jambu (edible plant that makes the tongue slightly numb, often used in tacacá indigenous dishes)! Super recommend\n",
            "Good location, with good menu options. Service could be a little more attentive, but nothing that compromises!\n",
            "... Now I would not recommend going there exclusively, as it is not so close to who is closest to Beira Mar.\n",
            "Several flavors options - and even if you don't have your favorite on the menu, you can ask to assemble.\n",
            "Very simple environment.\n",
            "Very good!!!! Family atmosphere, really reminiscent of a Grandma's house, tapioca is delicious, but it takes time.\n",
            "The bottom line is: don't have high expectations when you go to a restaurant. Not specifically at Fred, but in almost 14 years in Brasilia, I went for the first time to try the famous mincemeat. My expectation was high, so there was a small disappointment. I expected a more involving flavor, typical of a mincemeat, but it was normal!\n",
            "I liked the place, it's big and well ventilated. As for the service, it left something to be desired because whenever we needed it we had to look for a waiter, and look, it was very early and the place was empty! But it is worth the visit.\n",
            "I was a client of Paladino before becoming a mother, I went with friends to spend Sunday or evening to have a wine and listen to good music. Now, with my young daughter, I see that the options for children are also great, she loves the farm and the toys.\n",
            "Very beautiful place, well decorated, low lights which makes the atmosphere very cozy. The attendant presented the menu to us very clearly (my first trip to the restaurant). I found the portion of meat small for 2 people, but the side dishes are well served, I loved the rustic potato (a delight)! The meat came to the point I chose, very tender and super tasty.\n",
            "Prices are high, but very much in keeping with the location!\n",
            "It had several flavors, the pasta was thin and tasty. The atmosphere was also very pleasant. I recommend!\n",
            "Aperture is a classic in the triangle region. Always cold beer, several drink options. It also has several food options, especially Kieber, which is delicious.\n",
            "The atmosphere is also very good and the service is of a high level.\n",
            "Only unfavorable point was the strong smell that came out of a manhole on the sidewalk and ended up scaring some customers.\n",
            "Good restaurant, good food, good service and, mainly, local cuisine. It has live music and another environment (paid) to dance forro. Worth knowing.\n",
            "Excellent place to dine, meet friends, select audience, pleasant space. Music to listen to and dance to. It is worth knowing.\n",
            "I really enjoyed the Rafiq restaurant, delicious quality food, very good service, polite staff. I will definitely return.\n",
            "going well done, reasonable price, nice and well decorated place, attentive staff and has a very well done file. I recommend lunch.\n",
            "This is the best restaurant I've ever eaten in Salvador, excellent service, great menu, I highly recommend it !!!\n",
            "Excellent restaurant, generous portions and good service. I stayed 7 nights in Natal and chose to return twice. I ordered Prawns 4 cheeses and leeks, both very good\n",
            "Excellent place, a perfect bean with various tastes, the waiters of a nice education, do not let your glass be without the beer for any moment. Lots of fun with live music ... thanks a lot, I loved it\n",
            "I am a big lover of Japanese cuisine and Sushi Bahia is an excellent delivery option in this area. I've known the restaurant for some time, and their service has improved over time. There are always promotions, mainly during the week. There is always a good amount of shoyo, teriyaki, chopsticks. The price is not cheap, but I believe it is fair for the service provided. I have tried a few others (not many), but this one stood out positively. I definitely recommend it.\n",
            "Restaurant to taste new flavors, leaving the well-known Portuguese, Syrian-Lebanese, Turkish, Italian, French, German, Chinese, Japanese. Something different is worth knowing: Vietnamese food. Simple dishes but with new flavors. Spring roll to serve wrapped in lettuce leaf with mild sauce, or one made with rice, with strips of meat (beef or chicken) with mini roll cut into pieces with mild sauce. Very good, attentive attendants and the owner is a Vietnamese from ex-Saigon, currently Ho Chi Ming.\n",
            "I’ve been their customer for a long time, I’m always there and their food is very good I recommend they are worth visiting\n",
            "I was always curious to go to Confraria Uchoa, and I went on this 26/09/2015, to have lunch. First I'm going to talk about the parking lot, besides being small, it doesn't have a protection against the sun or a tree planted to give shade, and yes, there is room for that, I found a lack of sense, because at lunchtime the car is on fire. After entering, I sat at a table near the kitchen, and I was very well attended, and decided to choose the Famous Rodizio, 59.90 per person. Another point that I found negative was the air conditioning, because in a room that had a maximum of 4 tables occupied, it was hot, and I realized that the various air devices I had were old, I think from the time of the inauguration. Plus, everything made up for it, since lunch is delicious (there was just no option of shrimp), with lots of salad options, when the waiters started serving the meat, it was one after the other, and they even asked for our preference, with 10 minutes I had to ask him to stop serving meat, because it was plentiful and all beautiful. In conclusion, my account gave 135.00 for 2 people, and in another restaurant that has the same quality and options it usually gives 78.00 (tip: Residencia do São João).\n",
            "I really liked the Nau, a good restaurant, excellent service, but it's not cheap, and let's say it doesn't have that fabulous food to justify such a price, it's good, but the restaurant's advertisement is very strong, even so it didn't have to be that expensive.\n",
            "Giuseppe's meat is always of excellent quality, tender and tasty, in my last experience there the point was a little incorrect, but I didn't want to ask to change it, because I had little time. The side dishes are tasty and the atmosphere is very pleasant.\n",
            "When you go to Rio Scenarium, you understand why it is one of the 10 best bars in the world. Rich place of culture and art. Get there early. Avoid lines.\n",
            "Very beautiful place! Very cozy and very crowded!\n",
            "The good thing is that if you call from your hotel and ask, they send a van to pick you up and take you back for free!\n",
            "The service was delayed, almost an hour, because it was crowded. The pizza dough is thick and reasonable. I just didn't like the juice, very watery.\n",
            "Despite having considered the prices very high, the atmosphere is excellent, very good to visit. The people are friendly, the service is great.\n",
            "Quiet, attractive and welcoming environment! Excellent service, fast and correct! Shrimp Moqueca stands out on the menu !! very good...\n",
            "Right in the historic center, a bar that serves several cheap snacks and a brandy blend that looks more like a high quality liquor.\n",
            "Great option beside the Madeira River to taste excellent fish! Good service! Wonderful fish with super delicious sauces!\n",
            "Polonesa has been there at Hilário de Gouveia in Copacabana since I can remember. In fact since long before that. The menu written in Polish (with Portuguese translation for sure) has its charm. The decoration and the environment seem to transport us to other lands at another time. And the food is always good! The duck is delicious accompanied by traditional saute potatoes. But the high point you should order when you arrive for dessert and never forget: the famous chocolate sufle!\n",
            "I want to thank the reception I had yesterday 10/18/2018 I celebrated my 15 years of marriage at Coco Bambu Market Place.\n",

            "Privileged location near the hospital area of ​​Belo Horizonte.\n",
            "I recommend!\n",
            "The food is delicious, relaxed atmosphere, but the service leaves a LOT to be desired. The waiters forget about the customers inside and just look outside thinking about \"attracting\" more customers.\n",
            " NOTE: the house was not full the day I went, so the poor service has no justification.\n",
            "French food of excellent quality. Great cost benefit. Unique experience. I recommend. Exquisite atmosphere. Personalized service, sometimes by the chef of the restaurant.\n",
            "Very top restaurant in the shopping bar, the Pobre Juan steak is delicious, the service from the waiter Henrique Ribeiro is wonderful, I highly recommend it.\n",
            "Excellent dishes, especially the 4 available on the executive menu from Monday to Wednesday. I drank coconut water (and it's from the coconut, not from a tetra pak bottle). A delight, I felt on the beach.\n",
            "very confusing the service, no waiter, no command, cold dishes, finally a total disaster. unfortunately I will not be back\n",
            "The biggest / cheapest meal you can probably find in the whole city. The location and service are not the best, especially since its always full, but it's still worth it.\n",
            "Restaurant offers a good price, however the food does not look fresh. I went at night, the fish that make up the pieces was dry.\n",
            "The staff are attentive and offer good service.\n",
            "Best CAPIXABA muqueca in Vitória. Just wonderful! Everyone in Vitória needs to have lunch or dinner at this location.\n",
            "Unlike what I read in other evaluations, we had no problems with the service here. There was a bit of a delay for orders to come out but I don't think that's a problem.\n",
            "Very cozy atmosphere, very good price, shrimp broth the best .. Specialist in couscous.\n",
            "a great service with a great location, and a school restaurant with varieties of dishes, be sure to go.\n",
            "I went to my daughters and husband on a Friday (child's week) at lunch. The promotion was 39.90 with free buffet and dessert. The dessert was no saved. I expected delicious food with a farm taste, because the place gives you this expectation, besides being one of the references in Minas Gerais food. The buffet was terrible: hard and dry rice, totally greasy fried foods (potatoes and manioc), meat without seasoning. In addition to total neglect with the replacement. I found it really disappointing. It was worth it for the playground and farm, but I don't go back there because the food was terrible. Positive point: playground, attention of monitors and physical space. Negative point: quality of the buffet and food\n",
            "Excellent service! Edmilson and Alexandre, thank you very much for your attention and care ... you make a difference in this establishment !!!!\n",

            "Beautiful and sophisticated place for the beach. I found that there were few dining options on the menu and plenty of drinks and drinks. Ideal for those who want to enjoy, but as we were with a child I found that the tent does not offer options for them. So if you have children, the tent is not ideal.\n",
            "Very tasty sandwich and service note 10 !!! I recommend the Ribs and Salmao both very good and you can even exchange the fries for onion.\n",
            "I loved the emporio cafe! The menu is very varied and everything we tried was very tasty! From the starters: arancinis, pasties, to the quiche, salad and sandwiches! I went twice with my husband during the 4-day trip, because we really liked it! They have happy hour with good prices and good drinks! Worth knowing! The place has different environments for different tastes.\n",
            "It starts with the menu, it is tiring to read so much information, that is, poorly prepared. The wait time for the waiters was out of the series ... The food (seasoning) is nothing extraordinary, very normal.\n",
            "Good food, good service and no abusive price !! It is worth checking! I tried the spicy shrimp, which as informed by the waiter was not too spicy and I was very satisfied !!\n",

            "I suggest you taste any of the risottos.\n",
            "I've been to the restaurant a lot, but for about 3 years now, it has reduced the quality considerably. In the buffet we only find pieces with vegetables, creams, cheese pastes and dry rice. The difference is the way they are presented. The carvery has always been one of the most affordable in the region, but quality was not so bad.\n",
            "nice place, great service, dishes serve two people. The best of all is the tilapia with provolone (perfect). Very good.\n",
            "The menu is sensational, with options for vikings and maidens. Meat with real taste! Whenever I go to Vitória, Maxx Burguer is a must!\n",
            "In addition to several cachaça options, we also have caipirinha and caipirosca, both excellent. Regarding appetizers, Engenho has a very good variety. I really liked those related to pork.\n",
            "The restaurant is great! Pay to enter and consumption too but it is VERY worth it!\n",
            "We immediately thought that the beach and the restaurant are not very comfortable, but this place is spectacular, because the complex has bungalows, with a bed and hammock, comfortable sunbathing chairs, shade, a wonderful shower to remove the salt and cool off.\n",
            "Besides that it has a space for massage that is simply ARRAO !!!\n",
            "The food is very tasty and does not have a high value, as it is very well served for two people.\n",
            "I liked the place .. My cousins ​​introduced me and I liked the food, it's good, a lot of relaxed people .. I think I just kind of didn't have much to say because the day was very windy .. I would like to return but without wind ...\n",
            "It's not Mexican food! Mexicans would be offended! Avoid the rotation !!!!! It was a horrible experience. The quality dropped a lot!\n",
            "All dishes in the carvery taste the same. Everything tasted sour!\n",
            "Ketchup on the burrito was the worst! I don't recommend it, I don't recommend it, I didn't like it.\n",
            "I won't be back!\n",
            "Pleasant atmosphere with tasty foods and super cold beers. Affordable price, worth knowing\n",
            "I definitely intend to return! Freshly fried pastries, dry and very tasty! Very cold beer, caipirinhas on whim and various flavors! Service that is worth paying 10% to the waiter.\n",
            "Beautiful and well located restaurant. Attentive staff. We ordered a starter shrimp and it was very good. And the moqueca was simply delicious.\n",
            "I've visited the restaurant before and I really liked it, but this time I was disappointed. The food was good, but the service was casual. We asked for ice on the table and put a tongs that were dirty with food.\n",
            "In front of the Copacabana fort next to the Sofitel hotel, small and discreet !!! A delicious ice cream, especially the dulce de leche !!! It is worth checking!!!\n",
            "Coco Bambu is a chain restaurant, with standardized dishes, a huge offer of options. It's not that artisanal food, but you can expect good quality. It is a good choice of seafood.\n",
            "The place is not very sophisticated but the meal is very good and the service is worth it. Really enjoyed!\n",
            "Classic and best cod in town. Recommended by all tourists visiting the city. Prices are high, but the experience is worth it.\n",
            "During the week there are several promotions. The dishes are very well served.\n",
            "Excellent quality food.\n",
            "Look for the waiter Ailton, very friendly and helpful.\n",
            "There's no equal in the city! Alex gave us a thousand note service !!!! The food was delicious! Beautiful environment!\n",
            "The starters, angus burger and focaccia surprised me, I really thought it was in the best restaurants I know, great children's dish. But the dish I ordered Fiorentina, which was also delicious, was to be desired in the information of the waiter who told us that the dish for one person served well two, but when I went to pay the bill we found that the waiter ordered the dish for individual days, with this doubled the value of the dish compared to one. I left there feeling cheated.\n",
            "Considering that the restaurant is in a renovated area of ​​the city, I say that it makes good use of the space and landscape that it has. The space is very elegant and still resembles the tropical being of Salvador, in its decoration and dishes. The food is excellent, the presentation of the dishes is very appreciated and the enjoyment of the different and interesting combinations of flavor, in short, a marvel for the eyes and the palate. The staff is very attentive, available, professional and kind. Definitely proven. I will return safely.\n",
            "Very good, the best crab in town and lots of fun people.\n",
            "Great place for couples and singles.\n",
            "It is next to the bank of Brazil on Av. Rorberto Freire, a region where food is not cheap. The restaurant's proposal is to charge a fixed price (the last time I went, it cost 14 reais), where they serve 3 portions of meat and the rest the customer can take the will. In other words, it is a very simple place, frequented mostly by those who work in the region's businesses. For the price, they offer average food, it's a place I usually go to when I'm on a low budget or when I'm waiting to be served at Banco do Brasil next door. This price also includes juice, water and cheap soda (does not work at dinner).\n",
            "The breaded squid from Colarinho is the best in Rio de Janeiro and they have a great variety of chopps, including the homemade one, which is handmade and delicious! We will always!\n",
            "Who created the coxinha and risole with cheese dough was very happy !!!!! A delight. I will be back to try the sandwiches.\n",
            "carvery well served with fresh fish of good quality, well prepared. Excellent value for money, good variety for a good price. just don't expect a wide variety of sushi or different ingredients like roe in the carvery. Friendly service\n",
            "I like Babilônia, I have been a regular for years.\n",
            "\n",
            "In general everything is very good, the service and the food, but the scallops of mignon leave something to be desired, they are very thin.\n",
            "The fish stew with shrimp was delicious and comes served but the big surprise of the night was the creamy banana pie with ice cream! It was so absurdly delicious that I couldn't help but comment and recommend it strongly! Order this pie from the gods!\n",
            "My first one at the restaurant and I had a great service with the waiter Daniel !!! Very pleasant ambient sound\n",
            "We were attended by Alana, I ate an imperial dish, the atmosphere was pleasant, everything was perfect, we will be back again.\n",
            "Excellent location, typical northeastern food, with a fair price and great variety. I recommend.\n",
            "Shrimp risotto. It is the flagship of the restaurant. Really bad .. the atmosphere is great. But the dish is very poor. I sent it back twice and they couldn't get the point right. The risotto looked like soup. Terrible.\n",
            "There is a wide variety of sandwiches, the service is wonderful, the order is fast and the staff are very helpful. However, go prepared to face a relatively long queue and with a certain delay!\n",
            "We went for family dinner. Flawless quality of ingredients. Highly inspired chef to serve a starter with unforgettable cassava foam. Tambaqui with chestnut flour is also excellent.\n",
            "Reasonable price.\n",
            "Great atmosphere, fair price and wonderful food. I recommend. From Monday to Thursday the price drops which makes it more attractive.\n",
            "Good cost benefit. Well located restaurant in Vila Nova. Next there is SUPREMA Pizza, a very top pizzeria in the region too.\n",
            "The dishes at Abruzzo are well served, succulent. As a suggestion: mashed potatoes with pesto sauce, salmon and pasta. Accompanied by wine is a delight.\n",
            "The place is a little noisy, like any Italian canteen. The owner is helpful and good people. I suggest the more airy outdoor tables.\n",
            "Good food, cold beer and beautiful people. Fds full, you wait by taking one in front of the bar enjoying the fantastic climate of Santa Tereza. Go by cable car !!!!\n",
            "Cozy, air-conditioned place, well located, with great quality food. Negative points: the service sometimes leaves something to be desired depending on who serves you and whether the house is full, and the chairs and tables already need to be modified, tight, uncomfortable and old. The best of them: starter- carpaccio and Caponatta, meal - Rondelis, strudelis and lasagna.\n",
            "On Saturdays when there is samba it is almost impossible to talk, the place is always very crowded.\n",
            "The service is ok, draft Heineken R $ 8.90 and feijoada for two people injures around R $ 72.00\n",
            "Try the DADINHO DE TAPIOCA options, these are worth it!\n",
            "Very good food, I had lunch on a working day where time is of the essence. It was great because the food was very good and the service was very responsive.\n",
            "I already knew Coco Bahia in Salvador (which I loved and highly recommend) and wanted a repeat in Fortaleza, but the experience was horrible: terrible service, rude and insane waiters, running from side to side, pretending not to see us. One of the waiters crashed into my chair several times and I had to complain. I was with my husband and brother-in-law, we ordered together and my brother-in-law's dish arrived before ours. When we complained, the waiter had the courage to say that the dishes arrived at different times because \"the kitchens are separate\". Unforgivable: this can NEVER happen in a restaurant. Our dish took another 20 minutes to arrive. When we ordered a dessert from the menu (the \"top hat\"), we were informed after 10 minutes that it was not available. It sucks and I really don't recommend it, it's not worth the food at all.\n",
            "The new Grocery 130 looks beautiful! The place is bigger than the one in Serra, despite being less welcoming. But it is still charming, well decorated, with pleasant tables in various environments. The foods are really good! Always a novelty, with different meats and drinks of all kinds. We had a passion fruit caipirinha with very good basil and some draft beer, always cold. The starter bruschetta was delicious and well served.\n",
            "Pleasant environment. Good service. Dishes in the range of 40 reais. Good food. Great option for a quick dish.\n",
            "Good location, well organized, full kitchen, good service and good value for money, I intend to come back more often\n",
            "Great atmosphere and service, tasty food, especially the golden moqueca with shrimp. Very good for special celebrations\n",
            "The meats are wonderful, but I confess that I really go for the side dishes ... lol\n",
            "The chayote au gratin is divine, the mashed baroa is sensational and I was very sad to discover that the quinoa risotto with heart of palm is only available on weekends! :(\n",
            "The view of the sea is very beautiful. The beer is cold. Friendly service. A place for that: have a beer facing the sea at Farol da Barra. The food is normal, with no highlights. Common snacks. Crab, for those who like it, obviously. Just a place to chat with friends.\n",
            "Very beautiful and delicious restaurant. The atmosphere is super elegant and relaxed. We ordered the special octopus and it was divine and to close we asked for the famous cocada which was even more delicious. Special highlight for the waiter Gabriel who served us very well !!!! We recommend\n",
            "Excellent service, pleasant ambience and tasty food! Great for executives, friends and family ... I just leave a note about the children's space (there should be an environment for children - kid's space). In any case, the place is very good, I recommend it to everyone !!!\n",
            "Nice place, friendly waiters.\n",
            "Meat specialty but we only taste the starters. Salmon croquette and shrimp pastry were my favorites. Canoe potato, just OK.\n",
            "Churros belonged to the gods ... but only four little ones (photo) came for 21.00.\n",
            "Good quality food, but nothing exceptional. I found everything expensive.\n",
            "On the next visit, I will try the meats ...\n",
            "Lunch with 5 more friends. We bought 2 dishes and served 6 people. Good price and good food. Starter crab shell for 8 reais. Approved.. ...\n",
            "It has waiters who wear clothes characteristic of the Northeast region, which is already quite positive for a restaurant that serves Northeastern food. The food is simply a show. I highly recommend it.\n",
            "We went to Barranco on Saturday night. Traditional POA place, we order a portion of polenta and a heart of starter. For the main course we ordered a parmigiana. Very well served, we ate between 3 people, file cut in the spoon so soft. We highly recommend !!!\n",
            "The food well served, neat and very tasty. I liked it so much that we spent the three days we stayed in SP at the restaurant because we realized it was honest food.\n",
            "I ordered a pizza by phone, for delivery to the hotel where I was staying. The delivery was fast and the pizza is very well prepared, with crispy and thin crust and fresh ingredients.\n",
            "We love the location! The bar is beautiful! In fact we just want to go back to enjoy the bar! Regarding the dishes, we have the following comments:\n",
            "\n",
            "Starters: Burrata (spectacular) and a type of octopus ceviche inside a coconut (very good, but it could be better served).\n",
            "\n",
            "Main course: Salmon, Pasta with seafood and a dish with lamb and polenta. The food arrived on the table hot and with a beautiful presentation.\n",
            "\n",
            "It was very tasty and we personally congratulate the chef.\n",
            "\n",
            "I thought the price was fair, because it is clear that the food is sophisticated, delicious and the price is the same standard as other sophisticated restaurants in the bar (around 70 reais each dish).\n",
            "\n",
            "I recommend the experience, especially for the live music that made the atmosphere even more pleasant.\n",
            "Better food, better desserts. Super recommended for those who are walking in Jampa .. Good service and pleasant atmosphere.\n",
            "A very nice place, it has a very large toy room for kids who have ... The service is very good, and the food is very good, I just found the buffet weak, but the tropeiro beans are very good, and the ribs are delicious. .. The price is reasonable, more worth it ... It is worth checking out.\n",
            "It is effectively possible to understand the success and growth of the restaurant in Brazil.\n",
            "Variety of dishes, honest quantities, good prices and, above all, extremely delicious.\n",
            "An excellent option for all times.\n",
            "The view from the restaurant is really impeccable.\n",
            "\n",
            "The food however, some are very good, others not so much. I liked almost everything, I think the chicken left something to be desired ... I was expecting something very good and it was ok. It didn't have much flavor.\n",
            "\n",
            "Nobody spoke English to help my foreign friends, I had to translate everything. I thought that was kind of boring too.\n",
            "Great fish. Dish well served. Excellent service. Tasty food and fair price. I recommend this restaurant.\n",
            "In my opinion, very good restaurant, attentive attendants, creative menu for all tastes, good location, quick order preparation and closing of accounts, plenty of cover and dishes, great playlist of ambient music, clean bathrooms, but ...\n",
            "\n",
            "1) the variety of Baden Baden beers is pleasing, but I don't know if due to the waiter's lapse or the establishment's deficiency, the wheat beer I ordered was served in a common 250 ml tulip, which impairs the experience of tasting a weisbier ;\n",
            "\n",
            "2) I stayed on the outside balcony and, although I had no problems with the service, I saw that a house chose a table on the right side of the entrance, in a position where they were hardly seen by the waiters and, therefore, sometimes had to leave from the table to be noticed by the attendants;\n",
            "\n",
            "3) I made a great choice with the meat \"Alto Paraíso\", but my girlfriend got along with \"Nova Veneza\", a garlic and oil fettuccine that came in the dish flooded with so much oil. She didn't know if they forgot to drain the excess oil or if the idea was to make a \"fattuccine and garlic oil\";\n",
            "\n",
            "4) the restaurant seemed to me to be very romantic and couple, but on the day we went, December 26th, a Friday, the internal lounge had a few tables crowded with people, probably in social gatherings. I don't know if it was an exceptional occasion, but the interior of the hall was a deafening noise, looking like a bar at the end of the world cup. I think that the not so high ceilings and the fact that the windows are closed helped the acoustic affection not romantic for those inside. Thankfully, I stayed on the porch outside;\n",
            "\n",
            "5) because of the region where it is located, on the same street as Thiosti, Contemporane, L'Etoile D'Argent, whoever is driving must already prepare themselves psychologically to go around and around the blocks in search of a place.\n",
            "\n",
            "In addition, I would classify the establishment as a \"more of the same\" which, although not so marked as to differentiate itself from competitors, satisfactorily meets the expectations of being a good restaurant.\n",
            "What a delicious place! For those who like a cozy atmosphere, with live music in the background. Excellent service! Delicious food!!!\n",
            "I really like the crab island. Bc will find the traditional Capixaba Muqueca and many other dishes\n",
            "The shrimp in the coconut is very good and you ask for one comes two\n",
            "I went with my husband and son, we were very well attended by the waiter André, very kind.\n",
            "But in relation to the food it left a little to be desired ....\n",
            "We ordered “Picanha imported” which was extremely tough, the side dishes were good, but for the price I think they should improve the meat.\n",
            "Good pizzeria for those who enjoy a good service combined with a good pizza and a good price! Nice place and worth the visit\n",
            "Bavarian Hauss is located on the Orla de Atalaia close to several hotels and a courtyard with typical food stalls.\n",
            "It has very good service and environment. The pies are delicious. I recommend.\n",
            "I went with my wife to eat a moqueca in this restaurant, I ordered the shrimp for two people, who would perfectly serve 4 hungry people and it was delicious, not very strong, in the exact measure, R $ 69.00.\n",
            "I ordered a fish dumpling that was very good too.\n",
            "The service was also nice, only the restaurant premises were not the best, but I recommend it.\n",
            "Excellent food and service from the manager Ivanildo!\n",
            "Wonderful location and climate!\n",
            "Super Indic\n",
            "Great restaurant, super cozy atmosphere, food with exceptional flavor, excellent service and wonderful wine. Loved this place is recommend.\n",
            "I really liked the external decoration, it looks like a big balcony full of plants and pots hanging on the wall. Very tasty environment. Inside it is very wide, it has a cellar right at the entrance, several tables.\n",
            "Great vegetarian restaurant, but only open for lunch, it is in the Renaissance and a quiet street, food served at the kilo, very tasty and diverse.\n",
            "Modelers and a very bohemian bar and restaurant, downtown area, until late at night. The location is picturesque to go by day (full of used book libraries) but caution is advised if you choose to go at night. Good food.\n",
            "Excellent dish (Maria Bonita), service (Joyce, Joelma and Nilson), dessert (cocada from Pernambuco) ...\n",
            "Beautiful, cozy, well decorated place. Nice service is friendly. Very good, well-prepared starters. Quality breads. But, the tomato sauce spoiled my pasta that was on the tooth. Good price. I hope it gets better soon.\n",
            "Very good service fast practical just coffee that took a little while\n",
            "Caipirinha good hot and very cold\n",
            "Great attendant\n",
            "The service is simply sensational. Super attentive and friendly girls. The dishes are delicious and very well presented. It is very worth knowing.\n",
            "Super intimate, romantic atmosphere, first class service! I highly recommend the shrimp and cheese starter !! The dishes came hot, delicious and well served. The prices are fair and the food is well served !!\n",
            "Delicious food, very good service, super cool and pleasant atmosphere, both from the Morumbi portal, and from the Eldorado, Market Place, and Morumbi shopping units.\n",
            "Very good for gathering friends.\n",
            "Love.\n",
            "One of my favorites. Always surprising, from juices to desserts.\n",
            "The service is also always excellent.\n",
            "Nice place, well decorated, in a good location, great service and snacks and drinks are tasty and well served\n",
            "I went to the new Akquimia store, located in front of Parque Olhos DʻAgua. The menu is quite varied and the açaí is very tasty. I recommend!\n",
            "Great service, I was attended very quickly !!! despite being very full I was very well received by the staff.\n",
            "Very good food, well served dishes and fair prices ...\n",
            "I suggest using angostura in piscosouer, please don't put cinnamon !!!!! I've had the same experience in other Peruvian restaurants here in Rio, it's a massacre in the drink ...\n",
            "Great service . . . Best sashimi sushi, grilled salmon Wonderful 😍 orders come fast on the table super recommended ...\n",
            "Amazing! The gum is a must, it's an excellent dish, impossible not to like! Both dishes are excellent!\n",
            "Excelent reception. Perfect menu, which is well known by the chain. Own parking and for security it is good to use it.\n",
            "On vacation with my family we spent a day at Croco Beach. One of the best days we spent in Fortaleza. Delicious lunch, good pools, beautiful environment to fill your eyes. Prices are not the lowest, but the quality is worth it. Do not let to go.\n",
            "I always went to Fausto & Manoel in Brasília and I always liked the service, the food and the affordable price, the one at Pontão was no different, everything was very good, cold draft beer and good food, not to mention MARAVILHOSAA view.\n",
            "The buffet is not very large, but the dishes are very varied. Very good location. Reasonable facilities. Customer service cortez. 100% hygiene. Fair and compatible price. I recommend it to everyone.\n",
            "Good service. Pleasant environment. Price salted by the quantity offered. Perhaps further exploration of the menu could reveal some surprises ...\n",
            "Worth the visit, but without excitement.\n",
            "Well I visited the place I liked the sweets they are delicious and there are also delicious cakes the prices are good and the service was good I recommend.\n",
            "Excellent açaí at Bessa. In addition to having quick snacks to be consumed after a trip on the beach. I recommend.\n",
            "We were in 3 couples. The place is small, but the sound was very nice, the waiters were attentive and the price of the bill was average. The bathroom was clean and there was a person there for continuous cleaning. We arrived it was almost midnight and it was possible to go in peacefully without waiting.\n",
            "It is the best Japanese food restaurant I have ever been to. Varied menu, everything very well done, pleasant atmosphere and good service. I thought the price was worth it.\n",
            "I had already had lunch at the restaurant, we ordered a shrimp bobó which this time I found very poorly served with shrimp, it tastes good but the small and few prawns floated, I think that there should be no savings in specific dishes because I am from Espírito Santo and I can compare with others options, I'll be back but I won't order this dish anymore!\n",
            "I came to Coco Bamboo Bahia, super friendly, pleasant atmosphere, good service, wonderful food! It's super worth it!\n",
            "Well, mainly, to enjoy the late afternoon, seeing the Guajará bay. Later, there is live music.\n",
            "Any of the three is wonderful. In Cameroon \"from above\", that is, on Avenida Roberto Freire, I recommend the Camarão Potiguar dish. In the other two (the \"bottom\" and the Midway) there is the fish with Sicilian risotto. Divine! And yet, the desserts: a thousand sheets of chocolate, petit gateau or tiramissu. Everything perfect!\n",
            "I remember that I ate what they call crunchy shrimp (breaded) ... absurdly greasy, but justice is done the portion was generous, so much that I could not stand eating anymore (mainly because it was bad), but the shrimp did not end. Another negative point is the bathroom being in the middle of the corridor, with passage to the tables, I discovered how bad it is the fact that the bathroom is no longer hidden in a restaurant due to the bad smell after a user with a stomach ache uses it (* tense * ) and having to resort to the outside environment with people smoking on one side and the other contributed to my dissatisfaction.\n",
            "Pizza well served, full of filling, thin crust. Wide variety of flavors but the best is tacchino, a pizza with catupiry cheese, turkey breast and leek! From Gods! Delivery only\n",
            "All pizzas are delicious. The stuffed potato is also quite tasty. The atmosphere, decoration and music are very pleasant.\n",
            "The restaurant is very large and sophisticated, as such, charges for it.\n",
            "Their specialty is meat, but my order was a funghi risotto, which by the way was delicious. The dish is sold as individual, however, it serves 2 people quietly.\n",
            "Very well located place, pleasant atmosphere, very good dirty beer and quality live music. More than recommended. Sâmia excellent in service\n",
            "Good music; pleasant atmosphere and excellent service. The waiter Beto is great! A top-notch professional! Attentive and very nice. Really good! Congratulations !!\n",
            "The draft beer and drinks were at great prices. Option to go up to the terrace for a smoking area and louder sound.\n",
            "The atmosphere is reminiscent of a country house, from the entrance, where you can see a gigantic pot of coffee, to tables, chairs, rustic stairs. The food is good, very typical, but I confess I was disappointed. There were very few options for meat and everything in general. The food is delicious, but after spending a few good minutes waiting in a reservation line, I expected more. I know here in Brasilia regional places with many more options. The place is very tight and stuffy.\n",
            "If you are close to SENAC and want to drink something and have a quick snack, this is a good place. The establishment is very simple and small, but the attendants are very nice and humorous. Good cost-benefit.\n",
            "Wonderful hamburger. Crispy bread and first class hamburger. Special mayonnaise. We love it. Very nice place.\n",
            "I went on a sunny day thinking that I would have a better structure. It has a clean bathroom, fresh water shower and space on the sand and outside the sand. The food and drinks are good, but the service from the waiters is very poor. The following situation arrived: I went to fetch a beer myself because the waiter did not appear. Then he just came to fight me, roughly, because I had done it. You can't even take it seriously.\n",
            "I really like the convenience and speed of Subway, except that the snack is very complete and you choose exactly what you want at the moment.\n",
            "Beautiful restaurant, especially the facade. We were well attended. The dishes were reasonable, but none really caught our eye.\n",
            "More beautiful than tasty! We were promptly attended to when we arrived, we chose a wine that took about 15 minutes to be served and was hot (white wine). The entrance took another 40 minutes and came only after asking two waiters about the delay, and came practically with the main course.\n",
            "Best chop suey in Recife !! Several environment options, good service and good location. I like everything there!\n",
            "For those who love meat, Outback is a great place. You can find wonderful and well prepared cuts like the rib with Barbecue sauce, which is a delight. The always cold draft beer goes well with it. At the entrance, the famous breaded onion has its place. Despite the slightly salty individual price, the quantity pays off and is worth a trip.\n",
            "Excellent food, pastries and breads. Well decorated environment, great location. I recommend ... undoubtedly one of the best in Aracaju.\n",
            "Charming place, Best to book before. Wonderful pizza, thin dough well stuffed, with different flavors !! Waiters super kind and humorous. Many famous people there !!\n",
            "We were attended by Dimas, super attentive and friendly! The food was delicious and arrived super fast!\n",
            "I already knew The Cook, but I hadn't been in a while. The service left a lot to be desired. The dishes took too long. We ordered the tasting menu which was very poorly served.\n",
            "Conclusion: It is not worth the price they charge.\n",
            "The restaurant is really well set up, typical of the northeast.\n",
            "Waiters and waitresses dressed as cangaceiros;\n",
            "The restaurant is a kilo. Interesting, as you can try various foods from the northeast;\n",
            "The place today and the most frequented by the bourgeois eaters of Fortaleza, has a waiting line and the delay is on average 30 min. So it is good to arrive early, before 8 am. The food is very good, and the service is provided by very diverse young people who give a special charm to the place. Very cold draft beer and top quality food. Ideal for a snack and a chat with friends.\n",
            "If you want to eat chicken drumsticks without flavor and cold beer with ice, you have come to the right place. Poor and sloppy service and the bill is salty. I do not recommend.\n",
            "It's worth it for the good cuisine! I chose to eat a fish that was very well prepared. For dessert, bacon from heaven (divine!)! The waiters could be a little more attentive, but nothing to make me think twice about returning. The restaurant is small, but it is not unpleasant. I recommend.\n",
            "Tasty crackling tart (not at all greasy) and very good deer! I recommend the Furst Oktober. Not to mention the ambient sound. Tasteful rock.\n",
            "With a beer menu with hundreds of options, it makes Café Viena the best option for good beer connoisseurs! The place is simple, but cozy! The service is very nice and if you have any doubts about the beer choice (which is a certain fact with such an extensive menu) the waiters will always be happy to suggest! TIP: Be sure to try the German sausages and wild boar meat! Great side dishes for a good beer\n",
            "On an 8-day trip we went 2 times ... Delicious food and a very pleasant and cozy place! Maitre Ivanildo is ultra attentive and the attendants are super polite and attentive. Lobster Alagoana is a delicious dish at a super affordable price (R $ 165.00 and serves up to 3 people). Do not be fooled by the slightly overpowered appearance, as prices are very affordable. Super recommend !!!\n",
            "Very good restaurant, besides providing tables with a view to the sea, it has a very assorted menu with seafood ... Crab well served, cold beer, neat main course. Cool environment for couples, family or friends.\n",

            "Very nice place. Cultural center is an incredible space, beautiful, calm, it covers several tribes of different people. Great place to stroll, rest or study. Restaurant has a high price.\n",
            "It has a beautiful view, the food is good but the prices are high. Okay out there if the waiter didn't spend all the time putting water on the table at abusive prices that we didn't ask for !!!\n",

            "A small sale of regional food, especially tacacá and vatapá, prepared the way regional food demands.\n",
            "Bah has a sophisticated atmosphere, but its dishes are very expensive for the type of food. Typical gaucho dishes, overpriced. Small quantity dishes. Bistro price, but not worth it. I'm not going back there.\n",

            "Wednesday, 02/22/2017, noon and a half. Due to lack of time and appetite, I opted for the buffet by the kilo, in the almost crowded basement of the restaurant (on the ground floor there is the à la carte service and the carvery, from 120 reais). Wide ambience, very noisy like almost all restaurants in Rio (nowadays it seems that the majority of Rio diners cannot communicate without howling ...). The air conditioning was weak for my taste.\n",
            "The service is exceptionally fast, efficient and friendly to Rio standards.\n",
            "Wide variety of dishes, very well presented. Everyone I tried was from reasonable to very good, prepared with care and competence, and with ingredients of excellent quality. Highlight for the cold, thin cuts, of roast beef (of rump?), Soft and tasty and, rare, in the right cooking (point for rare).\n",
            "The Japanese buffet looked great, but I didn't have time to face the long line of customers.\n",
            "I paid 34 reais for a frugal dish and a can of soda, a price that, given the quality and for Rio de Janeiro, represents a good cost / benefit ratio.\n",
            "I've been to Le Grand Burger many times, but I still haven't left my opinion here. The best burger I've ever eaten, simply because it combines the flavor and technique of haute cuisine to deliver a new experience. My favorite is Delices D'Abricot, which has an incredible apricot chutney !!! Every detail is taken care of and I will be back many times !!\n",
            "I waited for hours, they didn't place my order. Just a sushiman to serve many people, few waiters. I'll never go back to that place !!!\n",
            "Good service and great food. The 2 person option comes with plenty of food. I tried a dish with cooked lamb, which was very tasty and comes with many side dishes.\n",
            "I went with my husband, we ordered pork ribs breaded with saffron risotto and fresh pasta with duck ragout and fresh “porcini” mushrooms the pork was excellent, but the pasta with good duck ragout. Excelent reception!!! We ordered an executive menu with starter, main course and dessert. The bill was close to 400 for the couple with glasses of wine.\n",
            "I looked on the website and saw that it was written that there was a sushi rodizio, arriving there to my surprise they said that there was no more rodizio I had to order the a la carte food which was much more expensive, and the shimeji was super salty.\n",
            "The origin of a family of excellent chefs. Remanso do Bosque originated from Remanso, another must-see restaurant in Belém\n",
            "I love pasta and I couldn't choose another place, everything was very well prepared, delivered on time, the waiter served us very well, I'll be back!\n",
            "Spoiled fish, I complained to the manager and was still dissatisfied with me! Odemira exaggerated in the service and even my dish came terrible !! Zero for this restaurant !!!!\n",

            "I've been to Tirreno a few times. It is a good buffet, with reasonable prices, sometimes I missed grilled fish (not always). Good internal service, valet at the door.\n",
            "It is a restaurant with a very diverse menu with regional food, seafood and a good barbecue. I always go to lunch and also to have drinks. Fair price and very good service\n",
            "Tapioca of different flavors, all delicious. I went a few times during my stay and I'm crazy to go back again. The size of the tapioca is to make any belly full. Too yummy!\n",
            "Bar established a long time ago, famous for the creamy draft beer, very tasty snacks, but the price is not very inviting, but it is worth the visit, even after the change of owner!\n",
            "I love going to that restaurant, there are always several options for salads and throughout the week the salads change ... and I love the Mexican; the meat options are also very good\n",
            "a large place, good service more in compensation the price exaggerates drinks and snacks very expensive, but for those who are adept at ostentation and a good place.\n",
            "We went for a snack at Empadinhas Barnabé, the service was fast and in a few minutes we had our order on the table!\n",
            "The pies were warm, the dough is very tasty but the filling I considered medium for my taste ... Matter of taste!\n",
            "Delicious food, with many options on the menu. The price is reasonable, spacious. A beautiful decoration. I recommend\n",
            "Famous in the region, it is worth knowing and experiencing the Tacacá da Base, even more if it is on a cooler / cooler day. If you don't want to go for tacacá, you have other options for snacks. Worth knowing!\n",
            "I was there when I had another name, and probably another team. Now returning as Brexó, I stayed at the tables outside on a Friday night. I was very well attended by the waiters, even though I had to open a command directly with the hostess ... I ordered a beer and a portion of breaded chicken (with a delicious sauce!), But the number of different drinks caught my attention! I tried my friend's one with tomato juice and vodka which was divine! Seasoned to the measure! Good option for happy hour and a chat with friends, for sure!\n",
            "I ordered the polenta as a side dish and was surprised, be sure to try it! Very tasty meat, great service!\n",
            "The restaurant is pleasant, in a nice building. The food is tasty, honest, but that's about it. Nothing special. The movement is great so be prepared to wait in line, or get there early (before 7 pm). The service is good, but there could be more waiters!\n",
            "The view alone is worth it.\n",
            "Excelent reception. You feel like a king on the spot. The waiters are super friendly.\n",
            "Great varieties of salad, as the hot dishes go straight to the table, so always warm and fresh. It has special cuts of meat. Not just any steakhouse that offers sausage all the time.\n",
            "I found the fair value for what it offers.\n",
            "Some dishes are really good. Some are well within normality ... which must be evaluated for cost benefit, since prices are usually high.\n",
            "The menu is varied and in fact the pizza is very good. The cost-benefit is very good. At night the ambient and live music are well selected. Super nice.\n",
            "It has downtown near the post office and close to the mall! Two houses with nice and tasty food, fish, shrimp, salads, the tuna lasagna is a must see !! coca cola is missing, only juice !!,\n",
            "My first experience was so good that I decided to come back, I love this restaurant, the service is perfect, it is simple and cozy, the food is always tasty.\n",
            "This restaurant is the typical tourist restaurant. The waitresses are dressed in baianas and many people take pictures with them. The food is good and reasonably priced. I recommend.\n",
            "It may look like any cafeteria, but it is worth visiting! Great juices at fair prices and fit in our pocket! Order the watermelon !!!!\n",

            "Good food, different dishes for those who come from outside Belém and want to taste the typical fish with açaí.\n",
            "It is a normal rotisserie style steakhouse, without major differences. The food is well served, the service is fast, but it is very tight, with little space for the waiters to circulate. The price is above average, there are cheaper options for the same level of service.\n",
            "We came to taste the snack from the buteco food 2018. Always well served, with pleasant staff. Small place in Tatuapé, but very familiar, with the owners always attentive and coming to the tables to know if everything is ok. I love the snacks, always based on eggplant. Worth knowing !!!\n",
            "It is a good place to listen to music and drink with friends, with reasonable service, but the place is well located in the center of Manaus.\n",

            "Traditional steakhouse in Porto Alegre, with excellent meat quality, parking and great service.\n",
            "privileged location; it only made a bad impression even when eating, the employees tried to remove the dishes, I confess that scared us.\n",
            "I was surprised by the service of Mariane a great smiling and attentive girl. Restaurant with great food and caip de seriguela delicia.\n",

            "Simple, medium-sized place, I participated in a fraternization of some 130 people. Many people are few waiters, it is difficult to evaluate. The little I ate I liked, good seasoning and good meat. Matambre and sensational boneless chicken.\n",
            "More familiar atmosphere at lunchtime, serves lunch and works as a bar! Good service ! Wonderful scooters, a snack of provolone cheese with dried meat and baum !!! Quiet place, clean bathroom!\n",
            "The cocoa show chocolate is not of good quality. The fillings look very artificial. It is not a chocolate that I would recommend.\n",
            "I went to La Macelleria de Lourdes with my mother for lunch, we shared wine, meat and side dishes. The meat was perfect for both of us (I like it rare and she does it well), everyone in the house is super prepared and attentive. Our waiter, Fernando was something else. Very polite, attentive ... Something that I think is worth mentioning is that my mother wanted to take some products home, and Fernando knew them all very well, indicating products, and even bringing the house's own wine for us to taste. I recommend without reservations for those who like meat, a relaxed lunch, and excellent service!\n",
            "Everything delicious, great service, always cold beer, but if you want a table, arrive very early or you will surely be standing outside with some drunks spitting on your foot. Recommend where owners take care success is guaranteed\n",

            "I was surprised that the clerk did not take my family's order and even managed to repeat everything exactly the same. Wonderful food. It doesn't matter which yakisoba is chosen, the meat one is great, the chicken one too, and the shrimp one is my favorite. China bowl is always a good option.\n",
            "The space is small but it is so cozy and peaceful. I've never had any problems with delivery. Although I found the delivery fee a bit salty, it was worth it for the very tasty food and the fortune cookie.\n",
            "All the dishes I tasted were delicious, no mistake. I could have better service. Its location is on Pinheiro Machado Avenue, the most popular avenue of the city at night.\n",
            "Traditional restaurant and good service. Waiters always willing to serve well.\n",
            "Excellent food, dishes are well served, side dishes are ordered separately, we ordered small portions, served 2 people quietly. Wonderful titty!\n",
            "Despite being written on plates by the restaurant and on the menu, it is worth noting that it does not accept any type of card, due to the high fee charged to maintain the machines.\n",

            "The place is beautiful in itself and, besides, it still has a wonderful bistro (I highly recommend the brownie). The space was all open for visitation and we were lucky enough to have a bossa nova band playing in the middle of the lake.\n",
            "I have been to the restaurant several times, the pizzas are excellent, the meats and pasta are very good and the service has always been excellent. However, for a while now I have noticed that the service has worsened a lot. I went to dinner with family and ordered cheese and a basket of bread. The cheeses were very bland but even forgivable, now the bread was horrible, a crime to serve something so bad. I don't complain but I called the waiter and said it was unpalatable, so bad that it looked rotten. He responded with saying that the breads really left something to be desired. I gave up dinner and told my relatives that I was not hungry, I wasn't going to let this episode spoil the dinner for the rest. There was the impression that the quality standard dropped a lot.\n",
            "The restaurant offers meat and fish dishes.\n",
            "The environment is simple and open.\n",
            "The food does not have much refinement and the taste is not the most attractive, besides taking a long time to serve.\n",

            "After two unsuccessful attempts to go to the house (note that it was on weekends and the place is super busy on those days) we went on a Tuesday. Perfect service from start to finish, very attentive, always trying to show the dishes and resolve doubts. The fries for starters were tasty and well fried, the sandwich was spectacular and very well prepared, drink of great quality and the dessert closed with a golden key (cheesecake with Nutella topping). It was very worth it to have waited and visited the house. Tip: if it is on the weekend, arrive early, around 19: 30-20: 00.\n",
            "The Kawa is simply impeccable !! We have been to a few times and have never been able to find any defects. Lorena's unit rotation is premium, including all menu options: different types of fish, sushi with different combinations, scallops, crab cakes au gratin, octopus, roe, shrimp, stuffed squid and the best hot roll I've ever eaten. Carlão's temaki is also an excellent choice. The carvery includes dessert (about 3 ice cream options).\n",

            "We visited the Sassá Sushi unit in Alameda Franca with the option of Restaurant Week. The restaurant is quite small and the tables are extremely close to each other. There is also the option of sitting on the counter or on two outdoor tables.\n",
            "The starters were delicious, especially the breaded pirarucu bait. For the main course I chose the combo, it is well served (18 pieces), but it left something to be desired. The most delicious was the dessert: mini churros with cream ice cream and dulce de leche and red fruits.\n",

            "And I couldn't resist, cheese ice cream (that's right, cheese!) With guava sauce, delicious! The syrup is overdone. And the portion is generous, so if you really want to try it, reserve a little space in your stomach.\n",

            "The waiter's service was good. However, the house sins at the reception. We were in two, the restaurant was empty, and yet we were being tossed around. We changed tables three times.\n",
            "I like everything about Vivenda do Camarão, the seasoning is excellent. The price of the individual executive dish is very good, as there is plenty of food. They always kill the same quality, because every time I make a meal everything is the same, excellent!\n",
            "For those who like pasta and Italian food, I recommend it. Good place to take family and friends. A good dinner guaranteed\n",
            "I went the night with my family. The Bar has a large area, well decorated and airy, and the temperature was very pleasant at night.\n",
            " Frequented by good-looking people, dedicated waiters, live music.\n",
            " On the menu highlighted the snacks that are offered at the table, we ate:\n",

            "I thought the service was very good and attentive, the meat was also very good despite the high price! TB accompaniments are very expensive and charged separately! But the price of the cover charge, which is charged per person, was what scared me the most! Mainly because its content does not justify! Carrot. celery, parsley, pate and butter, accompanied by grissini, cheese bread (which has very little cheese!) and salt bread! In addition, the maitre d 'asks, of course, whoever arrives at the table first if they want the cover charge, and when the answer is positive and the other people at the table arrive later, the cover charge is replaced, and charged, proportionally to the total number of people, even if they arrive at the moment the main dish has been ordered and will be served. This means that there is no time for everyone to enjoy this millionaire cover (which returns to the kitchen almost complete)! Hall is small, making a table perfectly listen to what is being talked about at the next table. And when it comes to a restaurant that receives businessmen, acquaintances, etc., it's embarrassing ...\n",
            "Excellent self-service! Tasty food, several options of salads, meat, pasta, etc. Highlight for the Self-service of varied and delicious desserts ... Very good atmosphere and service. The price is right for what is offered! I recommend!!\n",
            "We love the food. The place is very pleasant. The waiters were very helpful, perhaps there is a lack of cordiality in the treatment of the waiters, but far from being moody. And without a doubt the sushimans are awesome. The foods were wonderful, both hot and cold. In the end my wife received a rose. We are very satisfied and will be back soon.\n",

            "Nice atmosphere, satisfactory and attentive service. The two dishes ordered, although of sophisticated prices, proved to be extremely tasty and very well served, so the cost benefit was positive. It is worth noting that the pasta was served on a large, deep plate, in a generous portion, and I spent a little bit of work trying to win everything, hehe. Thus, Tartoni, at least on our first visit, distinguished itself from restaurants that charge dearly and serve small portions (\"gourmet\"). Another point worth mentioning is that, in relation to the second dish, the caprese risotto (which accompanies breaded chicken stuffed with cheese and sun-dried tomatoes) came with plenty of buffalo mozzarella, without the \"misery\" we've seen elsewhere. Given the above, we will be back!\n",

            "Lousy service, the waiters seem to be doing you a favor. The last time I complained about the delay and the service to the manager, he said that I was wrong because the dish I ordered was really slow (a dessert that took more than 40 minutes to arrive and didn't arrive). I asked for the money back and left. After that I never came back.\n",

            "A huge house with modern decor. Professional service and excellent treatment. We eat different dishes, all very similar and with wonderful flavor. To close the dessert was great. I highlight the rice pudding. Delicious. It is worth checking out and always coming back to this fantastic house.\n",

            "We visited the restaurant for lunch. We ordered the Restaurant Week menu, the options are good but what was served less. We ordered bruschetta for starter, the sauce was tasteless and without highlight. The tagliatelle served as a main course was ok, and the dessert, a lemon tart was pretty bland.

It is a very spacious, cozy, air-conditioned place but also with outdoor tables. Excellent service with delicious regional foods and diversifying flavors with creativity.

            "I went with my boyfriend to visit the restaurant and found the atmosphere very relaxed. As soon as we arrived I ordered the dish of the week, which consists of starter, main course and dessert. The proposal of the dishes is very interesting, but unfortunately in practice it does not work. The starter salad was okay, but the main course was awful. The main dish is the fillet with a tasteless sauce and fungi risotto. The fillet came over the point, toasted, very dry and with a burning taste. The point of preparation of the meat is not the same point of preparation of other places, besides the cut of the fillet was very fine. My boyfriend asked the waiter to change his plate and he resisted but changed it. The other dish came with a fillet that was not roasted but it was a normal steak with a little taste of liver and the risotto was not good. For dessert I tried the pancake which was normal. I was very disappointed with the restaurant, I was already thinking about trying other dishes.\n",
